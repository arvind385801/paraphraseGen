I've struggled with alcohol and drug addiction for several years and lately I've noticed myself drinking more and more. This morning I woke up still drunk feeling aweful and ashamed of myself. I am going to an AA meeting this friday instead of drinking and as the title said it's already made me feel a million times better. Knowing that I'm taking action to fight my addiction has filled me with relief. Just wanted to share.

Why wait until Friday?
All an AA meeting is is one alcoholic talking to another...If you have sober friends try to reach out to them ASAP...No point in waiting.  I know i never waited to get another drink.
why not go tonight?
I drank on Fridays too and only on days ending in  y .
