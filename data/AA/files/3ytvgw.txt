/r/sexAA..This is a new sub that could use some love.  ..We believe that the Twelve Steps of AA offer a program of recovery from sexual addiction.  We are not affiliated with AA but are grateful to them for letting us borrow their ideas...Thanks for letting me post here!

yes if just doing AA doesn't work for all your addictions but you believe 12 steps work for you- then go for it. Good luck to you! I hear they are helpful.
There are various organizations around this. Most notably SA SLAA SAA. They all do similar things but they focus on the abuse of sexual instincts. Just because you're not drinking doesn't mean you don't get drunk.
