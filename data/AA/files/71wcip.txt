Keep it up! The doors are always open!
Quarterly is better than daily.  Try for none next year.  Good luck man!
What could you do differently so you could stay sober? I certainly could not maintain sobriety without lots of support. 
Glad you're trying for better. Hang in there.
Just for today you're sober. That's awesome! Then tomorrow becomes a new 'just for today'. We don't get a cure or a fix we get a program and community that gives us one day at a time. I work this shit like it's my job! Oh man I still grumble about the 1-3 hours I spend every day on AA stuff. But those hours set me up for 21-23 hours of freedom in the rest of the day - I'll take that trade off any time! Keeping showing up and doing the work my friend 
Try working the Steps and The Program. 
Do you count days? Have a home group or a sponsor? What day are you on now? Do 90 meetings first 90 days. .
Looking a bit like Chris Pratt from Parks n Rec there. wishing you luck buddy.
