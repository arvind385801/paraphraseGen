I'm not sure how to do my fifth step. I've done step 4 and ready to do step 5 but unlike step 4 where there was a structured way to write it out I don't know what I'm supposed to write? Any guidance would be great.

Do you have a sponsor?
You don't WRITE for step 5.  You find someone to read your 4th step to.  My suggestion right now is to read the instructions for the steps as they appear in the AA Big Book.  Finishing your 4th 5th 6th and 7th are all designed to happen in about a day.  Then the 8th pretty quickly.  The 9th takes a while.
Well the how is up to your sponsor :) dealers choice if you will...Mine was done right after thanksgiving this past year. It was an all day affair. From 9am-6pm one Sunday. She told me to be thorough so I was. She was prepared for the day long session I told her we could break it up but she said it's gotta be all at once like a bandaid. . 
Listen to the Joe &amp; Charlie big book workshop. It describes it perfectly. https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/joe-charlie-big-book-comes/id687141143?mt=2
