Part 1 the beginning..You might say that I am not as extreme of an alcoholic as some.  I started drinking at the age of 15. I remember going over to a friends house for a birthday party.  The were all over on the side of the house with a beer bong constructed of a rubber bicycle tube attached to a funnel.  I had never had alcohol before that.  I probably took down two beers and had a blast.  Since then alcohol was a party drug.  Only on weekends and never alone.  Played football and baseball in college.  Partied on the weekends but only after the game never during the week.  After college the stress begins.  Job bills new people boss and travel.  I'll never forget the first time I went to the liquor store and drank at home alone one night after work in my home.  I suddenly dawned on me that I could drink whenever I wanted to.  Then came the daily drinks after work during lunch and sometimes at my desk in a concealed coffee cup with a top.  Thinking back my colleagues had to smell it on me.  After getting married and having kids I was drinking all the time.  Take the trash out and guzzle a few beers or vodka out of the refrigerator in the garage.  Waiting until the family went to sleep to crack another beer wine or whiskey.  Before long I knew I had a problem.  Like many of you I tried to quit a few times then convinced myself I could control it.....ha...like most alcoholics do.  I must have tried to quit a dozen times.  Sad to say peer pressure was the biggest culprit.  Going to a friends house on the weekends with the family for a bbq.  I would get offered a beer and I felt like I couldn't let this guy down.....he wouldn't want to be my friend any more if I didn't take up the offer.  Throughout the course of my marriage it seemed like 95% of our arguments were when I had a few drinks.  It started to take a toll on us.  Fast forward a few years and I finally woke up and said no more.  Actually it was the day before.  A family had invited us to go on a boating trip for a few days.  My wife didn't want to go with our young kids because she knew I would be drinking the entire time with the other guys that are also heavy drinkers.  We declined with the excuse that we had something else going on that weekend.  I then realized I was going to deprive my family of a memorable weekend on the lake all because I couldn't do it sober.  How selfish.  It was then I realized this thing had control over me.  I finally put it behind me forever.  It was like a huge monkey off my back.  No more hang overs no more fights with my wife no more depression no more anxiety No more beer belly and on and on and on...Part 2 Getting Sober..The first 3 days were brutal.  I couldn't stop thinking about it.  Could I treat myself to just one more.  Driving by the local watering holes on the way home just thinking how good a cold beer would taste.  I constantly reminded myself of the horrible feeling of hangovers are and the terrible regret I feel when I let myself down.  Each day was a little easier.  Day 3 was the most difficult for some reason.  In previous attempts I would go to a party and get a dark beer bottle go to the bathroom....poor out the beer and fill it with water.  This way people wouldn't ask me why I wasn't drinking.  Now I am over it.  I am doing it for me and my family.  I don't announce to the world I am not drinking I just say "no I'm good" or "No thanks".  If someone asks why I'm not drinking I just tell them I'm not in the mood to drink.  It's funny though.  I think we always feel like people are watching us and really care about our drinking.  I have found that people really don't care and it's not a big deal.  ..Part 3 The sober life..My life has changed so much for the better.  Once you give up alcohol it's like the handcuffs have been unlocked.  So much more time on my hands more time with my family golfing and work is so much easier now.  My income has increased significantly I'm in sales.  Maybe because I have more energy and without realizing it I am contacting more clients and in tune with the field of potential (Higher Power).  I can't ever imagine a life bogged down by alcohol.  Wish I would have realized it earlier in life but I am glad I have a lot of good years ahead of me.  To those struggling with relapse.  Just have faith.  You will get there if you want to be sober you will be.  Sometimes we just have to let it run it's course but in the end if you want it bad enough you will achieve.  I know it sounds cliche but life is so much better and wonderful without the booze.
