Well let's start with " I hate my wife she knows nothing about addiction". She isn't the one with the drinking problem is she? You say you don't want to detox but you know withdrawals kill right? Also if you've experienced withdrawals before look up kindling. I would suggest talking to a doctor and going to a meeting. Good luck. 
I'm sorry you went back out.   1.75 a day is a lot.   ..Dr supervision and AA is my recommendation.  ..I hated my wife too when I was active.   Turns out I was the problem.  
Your wife isn't the problem. Open your eyes.  Look in the mirror.
