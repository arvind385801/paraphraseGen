Hey there I think it might be helpful for you to find a sponsor. Talking through your drinking issues with another person can help you grasp the reality of the problem. It's easy for alcoholics to deceive themselves so the first step is being honest with someone else and yourself about your situation. It sounds like you've tried to control your drinking but that it isn't working. If that's the case you can try all you want but you'll still lose. Accepting that you don't have control over the amount of alcohol you consume after the first drink is the first step to recovering. Be honest with the people in your life despite the discomfort. I believe in you!
The first step is all about realizing that the problem is MUCH worse that we ever realized. ..Enough to realize that we cannot solve the problem so we need to give it up entirely.
