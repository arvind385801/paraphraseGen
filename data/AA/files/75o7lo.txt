I'm a recovering alcoholic. I constantly relapse. I don't have a wife or kids. I'm trying to find something in my life to hold onto so I can stay sober. What helps you stay sober and strong when you feel like drinking?

Sometimes thinking about all the bad stuff that happens** to me** from alcohol rather the short-lived "nice moment" I get **from it**.
I could not stay sober on my own. A therapist rehab outpatient treatment and AA gave me the tools and guidance necessary.
Since this is an AA sub I'll give you the AA line. God. That simple. If you are sold on the ideas in this book and I am then you believe that we are "beyond human aid". That matches my experience. No human power including my own could ever help me stay sober. So the ideas is that it must come from a power greater than ourselves. What you are asking is really very clearly written in step 2. .  That's the ball game from an AA perspective. The obsession to drink is lifted by a power greater than ourselves that is now operation in our lives because of our willingness to believe and to take a few simple steps.  
I was just tired of living a life where I couldn't handle anything and was too afraid to leave the house and too afraid to succeed in the things I wanted to do. For me it's just the perseverance that if I don't drink I have an opportunity to work on myself and become a better person. I really have nothing to lose either I work my hardest at being the person I want to be and then I don't need to drink to self actualize or I fail and drink myself to death. As morbid as it sounds that's kind of what keeps me from drinking on a day to day basis is that hope that I can actually handle my problems and be the person I want to be.
It's in the title of your post. I want sobriety more than I want to drink. It took me many years to get here. Relapse jail unemployment humiliation. I wish I knew the secret but one day I was just ready. Pray to be willing. Good luck friend. 
What works for me is to think it through allllll the way through.  I'm allergic to alcohol for me there's no question about that.  I have a very vivid picture in my mind about the after effects of my last drunk.  I had an appointment to keep but I was badly hungover.  Long story short there I was trying to be cool and together but first "Won't you excuse me a minute?  I need to go throw up in your parking lot." ..The AA saying that this is a selfish program is true I'm here to get sober for myself because I've come to believe my life has a purpose and I'd like to live from my purpose rather than puke all over it.  ..If my head is still telling me to drink I get into action.  I write out what's bugging me I call a friend I go to a meeting I meditate I pray I  clean house both metaphorically and physically and I turn it over to my higher self...By the time I've put even one or two of the tools into action the urge to drink has dropped  way down on my head's priority list...Getting sober and staying there is a minute by minute reprieve from the insanity of addiction for me.  I came to believe I'm worth the effort and if this parking lot puker is worth it I know without a shadow of a doubt that you are too.  Keep checking in and let us know how it's going!
Playing the tape forward  For me this is both positive and negative. How would drinking now probably end badly later and the how not drinking helps me gain more benefits for myself. Old Jedi mind tricks.
