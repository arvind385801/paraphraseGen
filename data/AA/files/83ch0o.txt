__***3/10: Important Notes - It's worth mentioning that this was NOT my individual therapist but one who worked for the inpatient rehab I was in last week. It's almost 4 hours away so I don't anticipate visiting this therapist ever again if I can help it. Also at the time of posting this I HAD NO OPINION ON THE ADVICE FROM THE THERAPIST.  I am just a baby as far as recovery goes and was interested in input from all of you. Thank you for all of the amazing help so far!!***__..I made my first post today as a recovering binge drinker and this group has been AMAZING. I'm 26F and 12 days sober after a black out binge. I attempted suicide and was admitted to an inpatient treatment facility for 5 days. There I learned a lot about why my subconscious drunken mind pushed me to suicide when I was  fine  when sober. Turns out you can only numb the feelings you refuse to deal with for so long. ..Anyways I'm home now and working actively on my recovery. Staying away from drinking has been relatively easy so far and the people close to be have been extremely supportive. I'm attending intensive outpatient support and therapy groups to deal with all of the issues I refused to face for so long and I'm really optimistic about my future. ..Here's the kicker - my fianc  and I are going to New Orleans with his cousin and wife in early April. We got a hotel room right on Bourbon St. which was done with the idea of drinking and no driving. This was planned months ago and we have paid $2500 in non refundable or transferable plane tickets and hotel reservations. ..While I was inpatient I brought this up as one of my biggest concerns because I've put my fianc  through enough hell lately - I'm not making him forfeit his vacation too. The therapist offered the common advice such as discovering the history of the city versus the bars stay back and do my own thing while they go out etc. But she ultimately had some surprising advice for a seasoned addiction therapist and 30 year sober alcoholic: .. Ultimately if you know you won't be able to go and not have a drink: plan your relapse. ..Basically go into it with a game plan a start date and end date and someone you trust to keep an eye on your alcohol intake and level of inebriation. She said this will make sure you don't set yourself up for failure and feel like a piece of shit when you cave. It also apparently makes it much more unlikely that you continue the relapse after this  end date.  ..Looking for any feedback or opinions on this?

No. Nada. Never.
I started working with people overcoming opioid addiction. Having a plan for relapse is very important. I'd learned relapse is part of the treatment. Planning for relapse might be more relevant for opioid addiction than other forms of addiction
