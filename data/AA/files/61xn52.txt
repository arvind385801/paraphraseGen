(I don't know if this is how it works on this sub but I figured I'd just give it a shot since I'm already drunk)..I've been drinking for at least three years now. Before the booze it was pot. I feel lucky that I only had a couple run-ins with harder drugs during that time because I could see it becoming a much larger issue... I have a girlfriend who loves me a family who loves me and so many who would be willing to help me. But whenever I'm not with them I want to drink. When I have a night away from my girlfriend I want to drink. I went to a couple meetings but couldn't get past the heavy implications of giving yourself up to a greater power. I don't believe in god and I'm not religious but I don't know why that would be the thing that holds me back. ..I'm lying to my family. I'm lying to my girlfriend. I come from a family of alcoholics but I still struggle with the excuse that "it runs in the family." I'm still very young and I know I can do better than this but I don't know how. And I hate myself for it. ..Why do I have to give myself up to a higher power that I don't believe in to finally quit drinking? How can I not find the power within myself?

Once I was desperate enough to do whatever it took that I didn't care anymore about my beliefs (or lack thereof) in a power greater than myself.  I haven't had a drink for over 2 years since that day.
I am an atheist and still found things in AA that helped me a great deal. You don't have to give yourself up to a higher power to stop drinking not the religious way you infer. In one respect you are already doing it because you are admitting you aren't "god" and don't know everything so you are giving yourself up to the wisdom of others by asking questions. aha!
There's a chatroom link in the sidebar of /r/stopdrinking. 
For me the key was to stop thinking about it and start acting on it. I went to a meeting got a sponsor and pretty much did what the folks around me suggested. After that I started working the steps and now I have been sober a while. I don't hate myself any more I don't lie to the people that love me and I have people in my life that respect me and I them. Somewhere on that path I figured out I did not do this alone. There was an outside influence. What you call it is not important. I just had to learn I could not get sober alone.
