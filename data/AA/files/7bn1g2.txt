So i'm now 10 days sober after a relapse - going to meetings praying meditating - I've realised after the first few days of feelings up and down - i'm now in a state of Limerence with sobriety - the first flushes of love and infatuation...I notice this and think 'oh well use this energy to get stuck into your recovery'..My sponsor says I've changed and now I seem to be 'getting it' by what i'm sharing...Of course i'm mad being an alcoholic - so I worry - I catastrophise - 'oh God I feel so good so inevitably it will come crashing down' - it's almost a 'speedy' feeling (I've tried most drugs in the past) in that I struggle to sleep (entirely normal at this stage I agree)..I often read early sobriety is miserable and hard work so REALLY did not expect to feel like this?..Anyone else have a similar experience? If so how did it pan out?..Many thanks in advance

I have it every time I set out to stop drinking for good. I know there shouldn't be more than one reference point for this...however I am trying my damndest! I have learned this time around (9 days sober since last relapse) that once I lose that lovely "limerence" (GREAT term btw) or the "pink clouds" is when I need to be more vigilant than ever to not relapse. I highly suspect that I hit a wall and at some point in sobriety and what I am craving is not actually alcohol...but the enlightenment that inevitably comes after. High strangeness indeed. I wonder/worry if it is a symptom of a mental illness like say bipolar? Idk all I know is that it is not usual. Thanks for sharing and putting a good description to my own personal experience.  
*Limerence: the state of being infatuated or obsessed with another person typically experienced involuntarily and characterized by a strong desire for reciprocation of one's feelings but not primarily for a sexual relationship.*..Yes. First of all that's normal. Second people seem to get limerence and the pink cloud confused. Lots of things seem good after getting sober. Third your body is probably looking for dopamine hits when it's down. That's why candy can help. It's also potentially part of the reason why you are in love with escaping into these feelings of limerence. ..I totally and completely buy into the idea that we shouldn't make any huge decisions w/in the first year of sobriety. However you didn't say how long you relapsed and how long you were sober before that. For me and this is just me I met a girl while I was drinking &amp; before AA. I try to believe I'd choose her today after years of working the steps but I know I wouldn't. I'm different today. She's the same. More or less. 
It's called a "pink cloud". 
Had the same experience. Had a strong pink cloud when I got sober this time.  My body was celebrating and my mind finally felt free as the cloud lifted. Colors were brighter food was amazing waking up was amazing I floated around just happy to be alive. I still had cravings but I learned how to let them pass. But the flip side eventually emerged. I started having big come downs of anger and manic behavior and general shittiness. My mood could flip back and forth in moments.  My brain was seeking balance and ping ponging back and forth and up and down. Eventually around 4-6 months in things started settling down a bit..I would suggest enjoying the bliss. Take a moment to let it really soak in but remember it can can take months and even years for our brains to really recover. Feelings of joy can be followed with an emotional crash as our brains search for stasis. Do not be alarmed by negative on rushes as they are a normal and natural part of recovery. Remember This too Shall Pass- both negative and positive. In sobriety some days you'll feel great and some days you won't and that's OK.  Enjoy the ride. I've found sobriety to be the most far out fucking trip.  I'm 2.5 years in and I often think back of those pink cloud days with great fondness. They help me recenter myself and remember what joy simply being sober brought me and help me through tough days. Practice gratitude and do no drink no matter what and enjoy the ride. My best go out to you.
