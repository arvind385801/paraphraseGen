Accurate or no?..Anybody have any comments on how the main character relapses (often it would seem from where I am - 6th episode) and then lies to her AA group?  I've been involved for a long time and I know addicts lie but I never understood lying at AA about substance abuse.  If your sitting in a chair lying how do people expect to really get better?

Not everyone at an AA meeting is willing to do what it takes to get well. 
You can do whatever you want at an AA meeting lie show up drunk pick up chips for time you haven't earned whatever you want. As long as you are not physically violent with other attendees you can do whatever the hell you want and never get kicked out. Many people go to meetings with no intention of getting better if it means quitting drinking. ..There is no sobriety police the main person the relapser is hurting is themselves. If they want to get honest great if they want to keep doing one of the hallmarks of alcoholism lying okay. Recovery works way better when you don't lie though...
Never seen the show is it good?  But I have seen people lie for long periods of time and admit it later  as well as not admit it. 
So are you saying this isn't what someone *should* do or it's something that no one does? Of course you shouldn't lie about a relapse! But I've done it. I know many many other people have done it as well. I lied to myself for years about my drinking. It was damn easy to lie to others about it even those who were there to help me. There is only one person who knows if you are truly being honest.
I'm trying to get an interview with Lesley Arfin one of the writers of the show. I heard it is based on her own experience with addiction.
