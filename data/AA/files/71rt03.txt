So I wanted to make a post for three reasons:..1) to suggest to people who might be exploring this page that you don't need a dui or jail or homelessness or to lose a job etc to be an alcoholic. When I first got sober at 19 I was at a prestigious university full time and working part time and had lots of hobbies/friends. I realized I needed to get sober because I was empty inside. I had lost my spirit and I began to obsess over drinking/using whenever I wasn't intoxicated. You don't need to keep going down the path your on that might lead to institutions or jails if you're struggling with substance (ab)use if you get really quite with yourself you might realize on some level you cannot be your best self using/drinking...2) getting sober while young can be awesome. I have so many amazing friends from the program who are my age and who more importantly I relate to. My biggest concern about getting sober was "what will I do now for fun?!?" Which probably indicated I had a problem. But after a couple months sober I felt comfortable in my skin I could be myself again and there are so many great things to do all of the time that I can't keep up. ..3) if you relapse (or need more "research") you can ALWAYS go back and be welcomed openly..I had 4 years sober and then 1.5 years ago I relapsed. Because I was a "high bottom drunk" and I thought "maybe my issue was with drugs but I don't think I was really an alcoholic" I did more research. The thing is if you're obsessed about whether or not you're an alcoholic drinking is going to suck... it will never feel right. After 6 month of drinking my life was legit falling apart but it was insane how much power and serenity came getting honest that I was an alcoholic with the people I am close to. I thought I was going to need rehab for the first time because I couldn't stop drinking but right after I told the 3 most important people in my life "I am an alcoholic" and went to a meeting and told a room of understanding people "I am an alcoholic" the obsession was gone. ..If you could see where my life was a year ago and where it is now you would be shocked. If you think you might have a drinking problem go to a meeting and listen. .

**High^Five for 365 /u/Derkenoff!**     ..Thanks for your wonderful uplifting post. ..Congratulations!..I recommend that you post it also in /r/stopdrinking. 
The way I express your point is that if you can see the bottom you don't have to take the elevator all the way down.
Hey good for you for getting back on that horse and doing it again. I had six years sober fell off the wagon for about 4 months and now I've got 45ish days of sobriety. ..It's hard having to start back over. Hats off to you for making it happen before anything truly terrible happened. 
What a great post; congratulations on having a full year!..&gt; I realized I needed to get sober because I was empty inside...Oh man I can identify with this. As daunting and painful as this can be you have great insight to pinpoint this at such a young age...&gt;  The thing is if you're obsessed about whether or not you're an alcoholic drinking is going to suck... it will never feel right...Totally agree with this and the common refrain "AA/sobriety will ruin your drinking". One of my rationalizations and one of the things that kept me from getting sober was "well I *can* control my drinking when I want to". The amount of mental energy and willpower to do something that comes so easily to most people was just a huge waste of time. ..&gt; right after I told the 3 most important people in my life "I am an alcoholic" and went to a meeting and told a room of understanding people "I am an alcoholic" the obsession was gone...This was huge for me this time I got sober as well. I don't know if I was subconsciously setting myself up for the future (or at least keeping my options open) but the first time I got sober I was "taking a break/not drinking for awhile/getting my shit together" etc. etc. Now if it comes up my response is "I don't drink". Those close to me know that I don't drink because I'm an alcoholic full stop. If it ever comes up even with a random person I don't know I don't have a problem saying "it used to be a problem"/"its really better for all parties if I don't drink".
