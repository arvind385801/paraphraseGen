I like to drink by myself and people around me do not know that I have a problem. My boyfriend [26/M] who has seen me drunk so many times left me yesterday. I know I need to fix myself. I know I have a problem but I like the feeling of being carefree and buzzed. What can I do every day to not fall into the habit whenever there is a chance? I don't feel comfortable going to AA.

So you come to an AA board and look for advice on what to do when you are unwilling to try AA? Maybe go try half measures with r/stopdrinking. There is nothing more important than your life to include your job. Your job will understand if you are willing to enter rehab. The key is willing. 
I have seen it COUNTLESS times now.  If you put that law career in front of getting help you WILL lose it all.  
Congrats on your higher education efforts. I do question if you'll be able to get your JD while drinking...that's a huge block to your goal and makes a very difficult path so much more difficult...A guy close to me sobered up in AA before embarking on that challenge and has accomplished much. Has his own practice now and is even teaching 2 law classes at his old top-10 Uni. ..In truth your drinking puts you at great risk of failing to realize your dream for your life. I hope you'll consider if continued drinking is in your best interests or if you should seek support to stop.
I went to rehab in the summer between 2l and 3l. It was an intensive outpatient program 20 hours a week. I was also working full time that summer. Believe me when I say that if you're alcoholic it doesn't matter if it's a "critical time in your legal career" you'll fuck it up if you can't stay sober...Go to a meeting.
I hope that you read my reply...Your post resonated with me: I could *really* relate to it...Almost exactly one year ago I was a 3L student at a top 100 school. I know that "top 100" isn't exactly the cr me de la cr me of law schools but I am from a smaller state and I would guess that at least 90% of our bar graduated from there. So there was no urgency to try and go elsewhere...Anyhow I am going to list some "accomplishments" *not* to be pompous but so you know that I can relate. I was ranked second in my class. I was an Executive Research Editor on our law review. My law review Note had won "Best Student Note" and it was scheduled to be published in our law review. I had also won 7 CALIs...One month into my 3L year I had to "withdraw" in lieu of being suspended because of my actions on a five-day bender. Our state's Lawyers Assistance Program heard about me through the grapevine and helped me get into a treatment center which in turn introduced me to AA. I have now been sober for over ten-and-a-half months and more importantly **it was the best thing that ever happened to me.**..*Sometimes the worst day of your life ends up being the best day of your life.*..Almost exactly one year before I withdrew (so almost two years ago) after years of daily drinking (I was a nontraditional student having left a previous career to go to law school (I am now 36)) I met with the elders at my church after a vicious bender and told them in tears that I simply couldn't stop drinking. I told them all of the psychiatrists to which I had been all of the prescriptions that I had taken all the prayers and fasts I had made all of the vows and resolutions etc...One elder recommended that I withdraw from law school and go to treatment. All of them recommended that I at least check out AA. ..*I had almost precisely the same perspective that you evinced in your post above.* "How can I up and leave law school when I am doing so well? How would I explain this gap in my education? I am too much of a law-school alpha wolf to have such a "gap" even if I attribute it to 'medical issues' on my r sum !"..Had I heeded them then my entire law school wouldn't have heard that I apparently grabbed a girl's breast at a bar. I have zero recollection of it as I was blacked out but for purposes of my recovery I have taken ownership of it. ..I had never inappropriately touched a woman in my life nor had I been accused of doing so. Also had I heeded my elders' advice then my whole law school wouldn't have known that over the course of a five-day bender I sent a barrage of romantic and suicidal texts to fellow students. I barely remember anything from that five-day stretch...If you are an alcoholic then you have a progressive incurable and fatal disease that *you cannot beat* on your own...I wish that I had better words. I have spent too much time talking about myself and not enough time offering experience strength and above all *hope*...I can only tell you that I was a *slave* to alcohol. It was my master lord and king and it kept carving out pounds of flesh from me until there was virtually nothing left of my life...I took refuge in my grades. I had given up hobbies friends relationships with my family self-respect time money and my own morals to King Alcohol. My only identity was the fact that I was ranked second. And my false identity and rampant ego convinced me to stay in school and like Icarus keep flying to close to the "sun" of worldly success and esteem...Anyhow today you couldn't pay me to drink alcohol. I am happier and more sane than I have ever been in my life. *I am **beyond** thankful that all of that happened to me.* Why? Because I went to treatment I was introduced to AA and AA saved my life. Throwing myself into AA and working the Steps has begun to give me back friendships relationships with my family my memories the ability to sleep and the capacity to be happy and content in most circumstances. I no longer feel sentenced to life...Anyhow going to treatment and getting involved in AA was the best thing that ever happened to me. And get this: I have more legal connections now than I *ever* had through my grades and achievements. It's almost comical. ..I always felt like an outsider in law school because I spent the first five years of my life in a trailer. On both sides of my family only one other person has obtained a bachelor's degree. Right from the get go I felt like I was behind the eight ball in terms of networking and finding employment. The only chances that I ever got were ones that I carved out for myself...Now? I have a cornucopia of AA friends and acquaintances who are also lawyers and judges and I'm sure they would be happy to put in a good word for me. Also I found out just a week or two ago that I am allowed to return to school in January to finish my legal education!..Though I still have my hard times I am filled with gratitude today. If you have the same disease that I have then it will eventually take everything from you unless you arrest it through AA and the Steps...If you'd ever like to talk I would be happy to give you my phone number via PM. If you don't want to talk but would like some personalized help I would also be happy to talk to the head of my state's Lawyers Assistance Program and see if he has any connections in your state: I'm sure someone would be more than willing to give you a confidential call...All of the very best sister!
Anything you put before sobriety you will lose. It's that simple. AA meetings are a good place to explore a solution to your problem.

In recovery I have learned that anything I put in front of my sobriety I must be prepared to lose. I tried getting sober 100s of different ways. The AA fellowship (meetings) and the 12 step program (BigBook of Alcoholics Anonymous) was the only way that worked.  I drank for 16 years with the knowledge that I had a drinking problem and I was never able to fix it on my own.  That being said no one could have forced me to get sober until I was ready. 
Here is what you can do: see a medical doctor and get a prescription for Antabuse.  It removes the decision to drink.  No AA needed although you can take antabuse and go to AA.  If you have a lot to lose you can guarantee sobriety via this method.
Honestly speaking I'm 25/m and had been drinking heavily from 20 until 24. I graduated when I was 21 and was working on my masters. I drank alone also and simply loved the amount of interest I had in the world when I was buzzed and was much more entertained and social when I was drinking. The only person who really knew I had a problem was my girlfriend who I had been with for several years at the time. .Anyways I skipped too many classes by oversleeping and had to leave the program. The only job I could get wasn't very rewarding because I was then on probation for a misdemeanor. She stuck with me though and I'm eternally grateful for that. .I'm a year sober now. AA sucked treatment programs were unsettling and I felt as though I wasn't cut from the same clothe as everyone else there. Also the religious aspects didn't help. .I just crossed a year sober and I know this sounds weird but what saved my ass was going on walks. Whenever I wanted to drink I would go walk for an hour multiple hours sometimes. I would put my headphones in and listen to podcasts that I was interested in and found myself not wanting to stop until I finished their story/stories. Then by the time I got home it's funny I had this buzz because I had been out moving around and sweating I was tired my mind was intrigued from learning something new. It really helped me sleep at night because until then I had relied on alcohol for that. ..TL;DR: Find a few podcasts you're interested in (fiction horror documentary everyday life) and go for a long walk every night. Take time out of each day for yourself when everything seems too hard and think about what's really going on right then-and-there. 
You're in a profession known for heavy drinking.  If you're an alcoholic you'll never be able to drink safely.  Might as well be known as the lawyer who doesn't drink. There is a well known organisation for alcoholic lawyers that can help you.  Also try young persons AA meetings. 
I don't feel comfortable going to AA...I don't think anyone felt comfortable going to AA for the first time. I didn't. I can relate to your situation. I'm an alcoholic attorney sober today because of AA. I came to a point in my life that no amount of discomfort could be as bad as where my life was headed if I continued drinking. That thought got me to walk through the door the first day and to keep coming back. Maybe you'll find AA is worth a try for you. If not there are other programs and methods that have worked for other people but none I can personally vouch for. Good luck :) 
Going to AA and working the steps are different if you are uncomfortable with the chaff like me look for a local lawyers / doctors group they do exist. ..Work the steps help others..
Hiya thanks for sharing. Some of my best friends in AA are doctors and lawyers and teachers at the universities around the area. We all have the same story. We were almost too smart for AA or any other type of recovery. There is something twisted about our disease that warps our thinking. People are always complaining about how marijuana ruins the mind but alcohol when you are deep into it is worse. It will make you think everything is ok: even after everyone has left you you are uncomfortable in your own skin and or your body is starting to give out to alcoholic damages...All the campuses around my home town have AA meetings on them or really really close. There is no greater feeling than being able to share with someone who knows exactly what you are going through: trying to stay clean and sober while having to study for weeks on end having the pressures of tests and papers and assignments et al. You might even find a person or two online in similar straights...People get and stay sober while keeping their jobs or staying in school but it can be super super hard. All of the recovery programs require other people. We check in daily. We learn to be accountable and honest. We learn to help others. We learn to listen to others. And through that we learn how to be honest with ourselves to help ourselves and listen to ourselves. Seriously online just isn't as powerful as face to face. However it can be done online.
I would try a therapist if you can afford one. AA meetings are not for me either I've been to 3 now and they depress me and make me feel shamed and broken I guess that's why I subscribe to this board. It is possible that a therapist can get you in touch with why you drink and that is really the main issue for all of us. 
I got professional help by seeing an addiction specialist. 
&gt; My boyfriend [26/M] who has seen me drunk so many times left me yesterday...That's to be expected. Being in a relationship with an active alcoholic is a traumatic miserable experience. ..&gt; I know I need to fix myself...From most people's experience there is no "fixing" it (only "treating" it) and you can't do it by yourself. ..&gt; I know I have a problem but I like the feeling of being carefree and buzzed...You'll probably keep going after that feeling until the problems become too great; the cost exceeds the benefits. For people who really like drinking (alcoholics) this unfortunately takes a very long time and a lot of pain. its what people in recovery call "hitting rock bottom"...&gt; What can I do every day to not fall into the habit whenever there is a chance?..Go to an AA meeting get a sponsor you can call and a network of other sober people you can call when the urge overwhelms you. Oh wait.....&gt; I don't feel comfortable going to AA...Why? I hate to be judgmental but this always seems like a rationalization to me. Celebrities CEOs of Fortune 500 companies politicians doctors professionals clergy military and intelligence people with top secret security clearances all have found help with AA. Why are you so special? Its an organization of people who want to help you quit drinking as someone helped them. They literally want nothing from you; not money not your story not even your freaking last name.
