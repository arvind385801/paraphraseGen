It didn't go well with my husband. Or at least not how I thought it would. Without giving too many details I relapsed and drank behind his back for a long time. He was crushed over the dishonesty. And still is apparently. ..My sponsor is telling me I did what I could and it his burden now. That doesn't sit well with me. ..Any ideas on how to proceed?
