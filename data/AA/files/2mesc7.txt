Background: I've had two relapses in the last 11 months. I'm actually getting better. I've been in treatment since September however I relapsed a week and a half ago and I'm meeting with someone who has the power to fire me after I've spent a significant amount of time with the organization. Things will be what they will be and I'm not going to make excuses...That said when the inevitable question of "What happened?" or "Why would you drink when you know you have an issue with it?" I would like to be able to convey that I want sobriety I'm working toward it I'm making progress but relapses do happen...How would you help a non-drinker understand why an alcoholic would relapse despite his or her best interests?.

I don't know that you can explain why we relapse any more than you can explain why we drink.  Non alcoholics just don't get it and that's why our program relies on drunks talking to drunks. We understand like no one else can...You might take a tip from Dr. Silkworth's article ["Slips and Human .Nature"](http://silkworth.net/silkworth/slipshumannature.html). It makes sense to me but  then again I am an alcoholic.  Still he wrote it for non alcoholics so maybe it will be helpful.......
Probably something like this........Alcohol reacts differently in me than it does in you and the mental obsession that I have in regards to alcohol is certifiable insanity and once I give in to that obsession I have a physical allergy to alcohol that condemns me to drink until I'm passed out or some dramatic trouble forces me to stop...I need help or I'm going to die probably choking on my own vomit or suicide because I'm at the end of my rope and I can't go on like this........Unless you're just trying to get the heat off so that you can drink again........
How do you answer that question for yourself?  Why did you relapse?..I'm curious to know because I usually find that there is a way to tell the truth to 'civilians' that can be pretty simple.  So what is your truth?
