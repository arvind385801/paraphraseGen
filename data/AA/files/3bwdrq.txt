I haven't drink since nov 23rd of last year but over the weekend I did some Molly at a party. Molly has never been my drug of choice my problem was alcohol and cocaine. I have done every drug imaginable except molly and wanted to try it and have fun. I stopped going to meetings about a month ago... and going to the party I had intentions of doing ecstasy. Another thing is that I have had it on my mind that im going to end up drinking so why not just do it now...... Did I relapse? it was only molly and I'm not going to do it again.... Id hate to throw away 7 months :( Also If I did relapse I feel like I should just go have a drink... one last time because id rather relapse on alcohol then stupid molly..... lol..

The short answer is YES you relapsed. Because you're asking whether you relapsed or not you're basically not sure about "I admitted I am powerless over ______". The first step is the only one that can be excercised at 100%...When you put something in your body you are acting like a person who has power over the substance but in fact the substance has power over you...Anything where you deliberately ingest something to alter your perception is a form of relapse unless prescribed by a doctor and taken as instructed.
Unless someone held a gun to your head or slipped it into your coffee I'd call that a relapse.  You had the intention of getting loaded and made it happen.    
Yes you relapsed. It surprises me that you could even question it. It doesn't sound like you understand or are truly interested in recovery.
I think you are in the final stage of relapse - I believe relapse is a *transition* from recovery to active usage. No one remains at relapse. They either don't use or they do use. ..Did you drink? No. Did you compromise your sobriety? Quite likely - but that's entirely between God your sponsor and you. In that order. ..So - what are you going to do to stop this downward spiral so you **don't** take that first drink?  ..Personally I don't believe that this is a relapse in as much as all of the cigarette addicted AA'ers aren't relapsing - even though they are 1) Abusing a drug 2) Active Addiction 3) Risky Behavior (cancer anyone?) 4) Not changing behavior. Progress not perfection...Don't drink don't think go to fucking meetings. The only day that matters is *today.*
"The only suggestion we have is entire abstinence". That's definitely a relapse in my opinion if alcohol was my only problem who's to say I couldn't do an 8 ball every once in a while? For me the obsession manifests itself in many ways the most basic of which is: "if I put this in my body I'll experience a head change and feel good". I'm assuming that's why you took the molly? When I put a mind altering substance in my body I'm actively blocking myself off from the spirit which is exactly the opposite of what the steps are for. .You can certainly go out and drink but you don't have to do that anymore. The very statement of "one more drink" sounds like you've missed some big concepts in your first step or you're caught up in that obsession. Call your sponsor ASAP pray hit some meetings and stay close to your fellows you already know the alternative. Don't look to us for permission to make your situation worse.  ..(PS. Don't worry about the cigarettes and caffeine unless you and your sponsor determine otherwise that shit is none of our business. Read the last bit in the family afterwards)
Yes. If you have to ask you already know the answer.
I relapsed by smoking weed. I'm so dishonest I told myself that because AA says anything that's not alcohol is an outside issue I ran with that to mean that it didn't count. So I smoked an "outside issue" on the beach with friends. I called my sponsor afterwards and he said thank you for being honest with me about this. You can either do your program or AA's program and hung up...I thought yes! He's telling me I can do whatever I want! It's my sobriety after all! And then I realized no my program got me here. So I want to do AA's program which like chickenthuggits says "The only suggestion we have is entire abstinence". ..So good luck and thanks for being honest about this..."Rock bottom became the solid foundation upon which I built my life."..Today I celebrate 1 year 3 months 6 days sober.  
In my program... this would be a relapse...But it's YOUR program... so you get to decide...I'd be more worried about justifying the ... "If it **IS**... why stop there?" syndrome...Jus' sayin'    ..Ummmm... what is Molly????????? 
Hurting yourself further isn't required. If you drink now it shows you have lingering reservations about staying sober that in proper circumstances (like people not telling you what you want to hear) you will allow yourself to get drunk again...You may have made a decision about that earlier in your 3rd step or if you're not involved enough to have done that you may not have given this kind of thing much thought as yet...Don't kid yourself that sober people will care much at all if you decide to get drunk. AA isn't against drinking it's for alcoholics who don't want to drink anymore. If you feel you must blame someone other than yourself for an action you want to take then why not pick smelly muskrats. When you're sick or screwed up you can tell people it's all the fault of the smelly muskrats.
Your mind is still running on the fact you can use drugs and alcohol. Yes you have relapsed my friend. Go to a meeting or find a sponsor. 
Yes
