I used to smoke weed so I wouldn't dream and drink so I could fall asleep. Then I smoked to feel normal and drank so I could sleep. Then I smoked to feel normal and drank to feel normal. Now without those crutches the nightmares are back. Exquisitely vivid and haunting. Some days are better than others and having to know that these won't go away makes sobriety hard for me today. I feel like I'm being punished for things I don't understand. 53 days today and this is one of the hardest. .Sometimes the nightmares are my ex wife. Sometimes they're from Iraq. Sometimes both. I've always been an alcoholic but I've never wanted to relapse more.
