What do you guys recommend when your disease thing backfires like this?..Personally - I believe the disease thing gives addicts a placebo effect of greater addiction. The word Disease is likely taken out of context because I doubt you guys explain HOW it is a disease regarding how it does NOT change your physiology is an uncontrollable way...How do I get my dad to stop using this as an excuse to truly believe he is in power? I got him to admit that its not a disease but I don't think he really believes it anymore.

You are not responsible for your disease. You are 100% responsible for  your recovery (and working your recovery program). 
Mental illness is a disease that doesn't always change the physiology as you noted. The tests that doctors use to determine whether or not someone has a personality disorder are very similar to those conducted for an alcoholic. Doctors have documented this pretty well and they've even worked pretty tightly with AA over the years but you will be best off seeking medical help if you believe your father's health might be at risk but AA is a great place to go if you need help living a better life. 
Alcoholism **is** a disease. And it does bring about physiological changes. If your dad didn't have this excuse he would find another. 
Who are you "in power" of ?.
Alcoholism is indeed a disease not just one but two.  An alcoholic metabolizes alcohol differently (read James Milam MD's book Under the Influence for details) than a normal person. And the alcoholic suffers from a mental obsession.   When it comes to relapse it isn't a matter of if it's a matter of **when**. ...**When** we turn our focus away from the course of treatment (for Alcoholics Anonymous treatment means working the steps going to meetings and helping others) relapse is almost certain.  Any member of AA that's been sober for a time is never surprised when they hear of a relapse.  We save our suprise for those who stay.  They don't call us alcoholics for nothing.  ..The odds are definately against us.  Yet in spite of these odds many of us do stay sober until our dying day.  On any given day you could sit in on a meeting in my group and find a room full of members who have been sober for decades.  If I don't screw this up I'll celebrate 23 years myself in a new weeks yet I'm often one the youngest (in sober time) in the room.  ..Why do some of us grab on and hold on while others struggle?   If we knew this with certainty our success rate might be higher.  If I had to guess I'd say it comes down to any one or more of dozens of factors.  Some of us get there too soon and are not fully convinced of the life and death fight we  are engaged in.  Some of us make a minimal attempt at the steps.  Some of us stop going to meetings reading the literature working the steps talking to their sponsor working with others etc.  I recently worked with a young man who had lost everything because of his drinking.  He dove in to the program with both feet and no reservations.  He went to a meeting a day worked the steps called me daily asked the right questions and read the material. He went from a guy who smelled from living in his broken down car to a man with a magnetic personality.  He started going to prisons and hospitals to carry the message.  He got a job doing what he'd always dreamed of doing and enrolled in college so that he could do it better. He met  a  great gal along the way.  He was a perfect example of how the program can transform us when we do the work.   One month after he celebrated his first anniversary he got drunk.  That one drink led to another and within a week he was drinking daily.  He tried to get back on track but he just couldn't do it.  I have no idea where he is today.  That my friend is the mystery of alcoholism.  I could no more tell you where he got of course than he could.  We never have a reason that makes any sense.  ..I'm not making excuses for your pop. I'm telling you like it is.  Unless he gives two hundred percent to recovery his chances are slim.  He didn't ask to become an alcoholic.  Once we cross the line there's no turning back.  The best we can do is treat the disease daily....If I could recommend anything to you it would be to get involved with Alanon.  Alcoholism touches everyone in the family.  You'll learn when to hope and when to call bullshit on the excuses we come up with.  ..You might also want to read the book Alcoholics Anonymous.  It will tell you why we do what we do as best we know.  That and the book I mentioned earlier will set you straight on the disease.    Just because we are sick it doesn't make us helpless...Good luck and best wishes.  If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask.  That's what we are here for..
Smart recovery aka rational emotive behavioral therapy...He has a behavior.
I must add that I am sorry your dad is enmeshed in drinking and it is worrying and hurting you. I wish there was an answer. The best thing you can do is go to Alanon which helps people cope. I hope you find the answers you're looking for. Good luck. 
Maybe try going to AL anon for yourself and don't worry about making him think a certain way
Unfortunately if someone doesn't want to quit drinking they are likely not going to quit drinking. There isn't an effective treatment for not wanting to stop. It's not a disease in the sense that flu is a disease but it's certainly an atypical reaction to alcohol. Do you obsess about drinking all the time? Probably not. Neither do most people. For your father that drink likely represents a treatment for an underlying set of psychological issues. AA bundles these together and calls it "alcoholism."..Personally I love AA and I've benefitted from it because it provides a whole lifestyle geared around helping other people and ethical living. But if that's not his cup of tea (and it isn't for many people) he can try some other options. Unfortunately there's damn little chance of anything working if he doesn't want to stop...Fact is as an alcoholic myself I can tell you I'm damn good at finding excuses to drink. Addiction is a mental illness caused by (among other things the current theory is) a malfunctioning reward system. That leads to compulsive behavior. Of course one has to ask what led to the malfunctioning system in the first place - often a deep down feeling of lack or meaninglessness...If he doesn't want to do AA but does want to stop try telling him to go to SMART or to a psychiatrist who can prescribe him Naltrexone (per the Sinclair Method). Again though don't get your hopes up if he doesn't want to stop...I wouldn't waste time trying to convince him unfortunately. What does "in power" mean? If you mean he has the power to choose whether to drink or not sadly if he's a pretty progressed alcoholic (of the AA definition - i.e. a whole number of psychiatric/emotional/existential conditions in one) then sadly he's likely not in power. Executive functioning is housed in your prefrontal cortex and that shit will be overridden easily by a malfunctioning reward system. If that's the case then he's not really "in control" neurologically. The decision is made in his limbic system and he will come up with an excuse at that point to justify his behavior. Whether or not it's a disease.
Alanon for you. ..AA does not justify drinking even if we have a disease.  We support NOT drinking and using the tools and resources available to not drink...If someone wants to make it into something else that's their choice...I have the same disease and was even hospitalized years before I quit for good trying to quit.  I don't blame AA for my drinking... I applaud AA for my recovery. ../u/lifeisb3autiful said it best:..&gt;Fact is as an alcoholic myself I can tell you I'm damn good at finding excuses to drink...We can justify our terrible decisions and behavior.  We love being 'victims' and have lots of excuses to keep drinking...I finally reached a place that I wanted to be sober more than I wanted to be drunk.  But it was a long road and until I was willing to do ANYTHING to stay sober I didn't.. .
The Book (first 164) says it's a "sickness" not a disease.
