Hello! My name here is carebox and I'm an alcoholic. ..**Intro:**.I'm 21 years old and have attended meetings regularly since I was 19. The first 8 months after my first meeting I relapsed all the time while slacking in the steps and not reading the book (read: my sponsor told me to do this I didn't and lied about it). After about 6 months I told my sponsor that I wasn't willing enough and told her to stop sponsor me and went out to drink again. ..The 25th of august 2013 was my first real sobrietydate I changed sponsor and was like "yes captain" to everything she said and really worked it. When I was 7 months sober I started doing my amends. The first five or so went fast (like one to two per week) and then everything stopped. People who I reached out for didn't answer or declined. According to her it also could do more harm than good to force amends on them. Like writing a letter was bad if we lived in the same city and they declined to meet over a coffee. .Also "I wasn't ready for step ten and eleven" since I should've done at least half of my amends according to my sponsor at the time. So for about two months I felt like my stepwork faded away. It started with me not wanting to make more amends then my defects of character was suddenly something I could use to succeed in life then my HP disappeared and suddenly I was an alcoholic who could manage my life and had full control over it. Then I relapsed...**Now (-ish):**.This time around I worked the steps with another sponsor and went through steps 1 to 11 in three weeks in one and a half month I started working the 12th step. We read and marked important stuff in the book and we did it all from there. No halfmeasures we were (and I am still) fearless and thorough all the way. .Step 10 and 11 gave me my higher power in a compleatly different way than step 2 and 3 did. Now I trust my HP completely. And also It gave me stepwork on a daily basis. It feels like as long as I'm doing exactly this I will never drink or do drugs again and it doesn't scare me shitless. It doesn't make me feel awkward or anything like that. .And I think the biggest change is that I feel stuff and it's not killing me and I'm not always acting out on the emotions. I can be sad. Like pretty fucking chest crushing sad. And I can be angry like wanting to blow up a building angry. And I can be filled with serenity and happiness...**Question:**.Now (sober for five months) when I raise my hand as an available sponsor people comment it. One girl thought I did the steps to fast and believe my recovery is just a happy phase in the beginning and that it won't last. Another thinks I haven't been sober long enough to sponsor. But the big book says nothing about timelimits.. (except for maybe a passage in the chapter to our wives which talks about weeks. Not that explaining though)..**Do you people think I've done it too fast? Should I start over and do it slower? should I not raise my hand as an available sponsor?** 
----------immediate responses--------

You didn't do it too fast...Continue to take inventory &amp; when wrong promptly admit it--but more importantly search yourself for fear and take your fears across the columns and find out what the will of G0d is for you...I tend to be concerned about what other people think about me even though I'm starting to realize they don't think about me they think about them. But that was a fear "What people think of me" and I had to inventory it to find out what G0d would have me be instead of fearful...I'm not in control of others that's OK I can't control what they think of me if they think of me at all that's OK...What I can do is listen be available be confident calm forgiving loving understanding generous kind comforting...Inventory is a powerful tool that has been laid at your feet. Write this stuff out and do a written inventory. 10th step says we continued to take personal inventory so if you're in Alcoholics Anonymous then that means you do step 10 you started it in step 4...We commence this way of life and don't rest on our laurels (don't sit on your ass and think you're done with the steps) step 10 lasts a lifetime...Raise your hand or don't. ..When someone shares pain that I've been through I approach them after the meeting and ask if they would like to see what was shown to me so that I could get through the pain that I experienced. I tell them that I know what that was like because I experienced that same thing then I tell them how it affected me and ask them if they can relate...Every time I've done this I end up sponsoring them for a while...I don't sponsor people to help them I can't I do it to help myself develop a conscious contact with G0d. **IF** it helps them that's great for them but I've got to stay close to G0d and perform his work well and so I exercise my willpower along these lines all I can it's the proper use of the will...At least that's how it's worked with me.
In Bill's Story we read that he did the actions required to stay sober while he was still in the hospital.  These actions had yet to be codified into what we now know steps but they consisted of admitting defeat coming to believe turning it over sorting out character defects discussing them with another prayer meditation and so forth.  ..Our book strongly advises against delay.  We read that after we take step three we must immediately move into action with steps four five six and seven lest we lose momentum.  Step eight is mostly complete when we do step four.  Step nine we may never complete to our satisfaction. (more later). Steps ten eleven and twelve should be done "as we go along" and continue for a lifetime...In my own case I had completed my inventory before selecting a sponsor. I was too afraid of losing what I had and for good reason.  My history includes far too many unfinished things. Had I not plowed forward recovery would have been another on my stack of failures.  I was three weeks sober at the time.  That was a long time for me...Your sponsor is right.  Once we take that third step our lives are no longer any of our business.  We have a new employer and He designs the schedule.  My list of amends broke down into two basic types.  Those I owed money too and those I owed something more.  I learned early on that amends means repairs not apologies.  The emptiest words I know are "I'm sorry" unless I immediately follow them with the question "how can I make this right."  The people I hurt were many and while newly sober I didn't have the resources to make things right.  I did not yet have a firm grasp on my parts in the injuries and now to repair them.  I did not have some of them for quite some time.    There were also people whom I had hurt that I had no business contacting.  My absence from their life was what was best for them.  I did not make this determination myself. This was and is always left to my Higher Power.    That does not let me off the hook.  I know that at any time an opportunity can arise and I must be ready to meet it.    I also must live in a way that I never repeat my mistakes with others.   I will never be able to repair all the damage I caused. ..As for sponsorship I'll give you my thoughts and leave the decision to you.  Ebby called on Bill when he was a few months sober. Bill called on Bob in his first few months. Bill called on many others too.  The vast majority of the men he called on did not stay sober though Bill did.  In those early days we didn't were not an organized group.  We were not called Alcoholics Anonymous.  We did not have clubhouses. We didn't even have a book.  We also didn't have sponsors not in the sense we have them today.  In fact you won't find the word sponsor in the basic text of the big book.    We did not have old timers. When the book was published the most time anyone had was no more than four years.  It is truly a miracle our society made it at all.  Today almost every group has members with decades of experience.  We have women and men who have lived in the steps for years and stayed sober through all kinds of experiences.    We have clubhouses and meeting halls that are open all day seven days a week.  We have come along way. ..Are you qualified to sponsor?  That's a question only you can answer.  As sponsors we can only transmit that which we've experienced ourselves.  Taking the steps is part of it as is living them for enough time that we understand how they work and why we take them.  We've seen our program stand the test of time and adversity.  We aren't expected to know all the answers but we should be able to find them when asked...I stayed away from sponsoring for the first three years of sobriety.  I knew the book inside and out. I went to meetings  daily but I still had a lot of work to do before I felt comfortable in trying to carry the message as a sponsor.   Twenty years later I still think long and hard before agreeing to sponsor another man.  When I do agree it's with stipulation.  I tell every man that I'll will sponsor him until someone better comes along.    ...In short in my opinion there is no such thing as too soon when it comes to the steps but there is such a thing as too quickly.  ......
I would say no...I started sponsoring after 5 months. I thought I had gone to fast. I didn't think I had anything to offer. But my sponsor told me I knew how to not drink for five months and I did have experience to offer others. From your story it seems like you have lots of experience to offer others. ..I could say to myself "I worked the steps honestly / thoroughly" so I felt ok sponsoring people. That's how my sponsor framed it anyway...Consider this: in the beginning Bill and Bob were rounding up alcoholics from hospitals running them through the steps in a day or two then those people would be sponsoring alcoholics within another day or two. Working with an alcoholic helps when nothing else can. ..I got into other service work as well (business meetings intergroup archives) and found that really helps keep me in a good head space when I am between sponsees. Nothing really makes me feel the way sponsoring does though. If you can see someone come through the steps take the tools you have laid at their feet and make their life better it really is special. It has kept me from drinking...
My experience:.I went through the steps at a really quick pace. Since then I have found a new sponsor and am going back through them much slower mainly using **It Works: How and Why** from NA (even though I am in AA). It's definitely deepening my understanding and practice of the principles behind the steps. ..Your experience:.Your experience. 
Those early to AA especially Bill and Bob did not have the luxury of 'senior members'. Now we do. Everyone makes their own decisions but I suggest waiting at least a year before taking another under your wing unless there are exceptional circumstances..
For me the steps are a continuing process and after a lota years are still helping me grow and strengthen my recovery.....But that's me
You raise 3 questions...1) Did you do the steps too fast? I don't think there's such a thing. We have all of our recovery to do the steps again and again. You'll always cut at another level...2) Start over? Always. My recovery is at its best when I'm always working the steps...3) You and your sponsor get to decide when you're ready to sponsor. What other people think of you is none of your business. If you're strong in steps 1-3 and 10-12 and your sponsor OKs you keep raising your hand.
when my hair was on fire I was willing to do whatever I had to so I could put those flames out. if you feel that you did them to the best of your ability then congrats! start them over! it wont hurt will it now. ..-24 year old guy 7 months into the program..-man have we been blessed!
I just heard an old-timer with over 30 years speak the other night and they said they did the steps in 48 hours. Now they've done the steps again many times since then but from what they recall that's how it was done back in the day. I myself have balked and am on step 9 at a year and some months. I could have done it faster but my sponsor wanted me to figure out what i was doing wrong on my own and take action on my own. When I was willing we took back up the steps. One of my friends finished the steps in three months and sponsors people now. We're alcoholics for ever so our program needs to be worked everyday. Working the steps just means that someone has taken you through them so you can give them freely to another alcoholic. Working on ourselves takes time. My character defects didn't just disappear I'm just more aware of them and know what to do when they crop up. I have living amends to make meaning I have to do them on a daily basis. .. tl;dr: I try not to compare my recovery to others sobriety has no "You'll be cured in (amount of time)" guarantee we're alcoholics for life but we are recover*ing* alcoholics. they can say all they want from up on that "spiritual mountain" but know that it doesn't matter all that matters is what *you* are able to do in this world.
