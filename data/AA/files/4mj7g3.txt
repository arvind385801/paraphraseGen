Coming off a four month relapse that has really screwed things up. I just feel horrible. Not only physically but emotionally. I could really use a good sob but don't really have any emotions yet. Plenty of pain though...EDIT: Oh yeah. My wife wants some "space" too. I don't blame her. Still hurts though.

First let me say welcome back. Maybe it would be a good idea to come up with a plan the next time you feel like you want to drink. It could be just calling someone hanging out with someone. Doing something else. Anything to get your mind off it. I certainly don't want to endorse to anyone spending every waking moment in a meeting but perhaps for a few months to half a year being very connected with a group can help. It helped me it might help you. 
I relapsed after a few years  felt like you're feeling. Went back and the people in the meetings embraced me
Sorry shit sucks right now. Now get a sponsor and do step work like it matters (if you want) and embrace the serenity that follows.

Im glad you're here. I'm glad you made it back.
