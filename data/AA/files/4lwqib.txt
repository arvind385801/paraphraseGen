Hey everyone. Like many other people in AA the God thing is kind of off-putting for me. I like the idea of God as you understand him GOD (Group of drunks). All that stuff to remind us that it doesn't have to be the Judeo-Christian God....Buuuut I've been working with my sponsor and we're about to do the third step prayer. This is my first time trying to work the program and I don't want to half-ass it but it's difficult for me to really give myself over to a higher power because my higher power isn't really defined for me yet....I think a big part of it is the whole "and to do with me as Thou wilt." That *sounds* fantastic! I'm just very caught up in the nuts and bolts of it all. Obviously I'm not going to wake up with a checklist from God on what to do but yeah...Anyone else struggle with this? I really want to do this and get onto my fourth step but I don't want to fake it. Thanks

IF a God exists I would hope that he/it would help me do good instead of bad (my self will run amok)...Good Orderly Direction (the steps) is the method/actions I took to develop that "educational variety" spiritual awakening written about way in the back of the Big Book...Step 3 doesn't mean you have/develop a conscious contact at that point and time.  It means you're willing to do the actions steps (4-12) so you get those promised promises and can live a happy joyous and free life.  It was from the action steps that I developed my wonky conscious contact with my version of a higher power...Group of drunks is fine so is karma so is science so is good orderly direction so it a sky wizard or a zombie son of the lord.  The details of your own conception of a higher power matter not what only matters is that it works for you...Oh and my home groups reads the 3rd step prayer instead of the lord's prayer at the end of our meeting.  I use it as a centering/meditative exercise as well as a prayer to whatever might be up there...So relax.  Trust the process and do the stuff.  You'll like the results I promise.
I struggled with this for years. Not because of the God thing but because I was trying to do things 100% (if that makes sense). It was explained to me like this: There is only one step we can fully complete step 1. The rest of the steps we do to our best ability. I was stuck trying to perfect this step when there isn't such a thing. We read it every week and I still didn't get it. "We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection."
Here's my version of the steps without the godstuff:.______________________________________..Step 1: I'm in a mess and over my head...Step 2: Maybe I don't have all the answers . so I'll ask for help...Step 3: Decide to pay attention to advice given. ..Step 4: Take an honest look at how I've been living my life...Step 5: Tell someone else about my unhealthy lifestyle and harm to others. ..Step 6: Decide to live a healthier kinder life...Step 7: Make specific changes toward that goal.. .Step 8: List everyone I have hurt...Step 9: Have the courage to tell them I'm sorry &amp; make amends except if doing so would cause harm. ..Step 10: Keep an eye on myself alert to old thinking and behaviors. ..Step 11: Be aware of the beauty in the world and people. ..Step 12: Pass on to others the kindness extended to me. .
To me the third step means I needed to accept that I wasn't the boss of the world; I didn't know everything. I realized that I didn't know how to get well on my own and was willing to accept help from others. It helped me not to take the words so literally. Remember that these steps and prayers were written many years ago and take that into perspective. 
You don't have use that prayer it's just an example. It tells you that in the text. The key for me about step 3 was the decision to "quit playing God" - that is the how and the why of it. I'm a past master of faking things that's all I did for the 23years that I spent drinking alcoholically but I.don't think I ever faked a decision I don't even think it's possible. So how can you fake step 3?. How can you fake saying "from now on I'm going to really try my best to stop playing God" I mean it's not as if I ever actually succeeded in playing God is it? Everytime I played God I failed and everytime I failed I drank.
Three frogs are on a log and one makes a decision to jump. How many frogs are on the log?..Three. ..Get to work on your fourth step and you'll be doing a third step. That's all you need to worry about at the moment. Don't overcomplicate it. 
The book says that "The wording (of the 3rd step prayer) was of course quite optional so long as we expressed the idea voicing it without reservation."..It sounds like you are committed to continuing on with the steps. So it's up to you to express this in a way that makes sense to you.
Late to the party but I was once told that 'my will' was my thoughts and 'my life' was my actions.  In the third step prayer I am asking for guidance for my thought and actions...The 'as thou wilt' part is simply my decision to focus on the process and effort (my part) and let go of the outcome (something I have no control over anyway.)..I personally like the [NA third step prayer](http://www.my12stepstore.com/media/ThirdStepPrayerNABookmark.jpg) for its simplicity and lack of King James Bible imagery.  The sentiment is the same...I actually *did* wake up with a checklist - the next 6 steps.  The third step was just the decision the 4th through 9th steps made the decision manifest in my life.  God I decided wanted me to treat others the way I would like to be treated and the steps were the template.  It was that simple.  The lightning bolt from heaven and wind coming from the mountaintop were strictly optional.

Here is a "non-God" approach to Step 3 that might be interesting to investigate. http://www.hazeldenbettyford.org/articles/jacobs-stewart/buddhist-approach-to-step-three-part-1?utm_source=publishing&amp;utm_medium=newsletter_ctc&amp;utm_term=takingrefuge_tjs&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=cn
