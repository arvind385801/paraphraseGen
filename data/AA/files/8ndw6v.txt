Stopped drinking over a year ago and all things fitness related have been easier ever since...Edit: Life has been easier ever since. It's amazing the changes you see when you're sober. I struggled with alcohol for a long time. The first few months that I quit were tough very tough. I had a seizure from alcohol withdrawal. After about the 3rd month I started to really feel like my old self. I was happy in the morning which was something I hadn't experienced in years. The best part about recovery is the fact that my depression and anxiety slowly started to disappear. Not only do I not take any meds but I don't even google search depression symptoms anymore. If there is ever any advice I can give to someone trying to live sober DON'T GIVE IN. Work at it everyday and I promise you it will get easier.

Thank you.
I'm curious as to what physically became easier first? And what workouts do you do? I'm not an alcoholic but I am a heavy drinker and last night I started considering quitting drinking so I can lose weight and stop drunk eating so I'm curious as to what changes you saw first?
