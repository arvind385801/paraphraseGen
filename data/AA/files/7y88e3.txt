I relapsed on tuesday night. Not so bad but it still sucks. I had a DUI class Wednesday night. Everything went well and i was feeling pretty positive and good. I just got paranoid and started thinking that the instructor could see that i relapsed. I keep thinking that i am going to get kicked out of the program even though i was sober when i attended. Nothing was brought up about the subject if i was under the influence or not. I signed the attendance sheet and participated real well. Has any body else gone through this? Anybody with experience in DUI programs know if you can get booted from the program without being notified first or without being submitted to a breathalyzer?

You probably would've been booted then and there if it was going to happen. Perhaps you're just feeling a lot of guilt about relapsing because you are in these programs?..  Glad you're back with us and there's no shame in picking yourself up. I won't drink with you today. 
That's just your paranoia talking. Keep doing the next right thing. That's all.
You're back start over
