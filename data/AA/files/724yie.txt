I went to treatment back in July 2014 went 9 months being sober then relapsed. It would be about 2-3 months sober then drink. Then less &amp; less time in between... Until now when a bunch of hard shit came my way &amp; I started drinking 4-5x/week. Not an excuse but it is the reason why. Being sad is addictive. I'm fucking done with it and I'm so stoked on life!...So. I'M BACK ON IT. ONE DAY AT A TIME. It's the only way I'll ever stay sober otherwise I'll get mad at how many times I've fucked up. My Sober Time app told me this morning:...**"The secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old but on building the new."**...PEACE CHILL AND POSITIVE VIBES EVERYONE! &lt;3

Glad you're back. Today is going to be a good day. 
The only way I could have the happy sober life I have today was to get help. I needed lots of it. Therapy rehab outpatient and AA saved my life. I learned how to protect myself from alcohol because I didn't want what happened when I drank. ..There is more to getting well than simply not drinking. Without personal growth I limped along. Having a therapist sponsor and working the steps taught me more about myself than I ever wanted to know but that's what I needed. ..What are you going to do differently so you can have a happy sober life?
