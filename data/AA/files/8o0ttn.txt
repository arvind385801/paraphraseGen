Thought for the Day...Some more things I do not miss since becoming dry: wondering if the car is in the garage and how I got home; struggling to remember where I was and what I did since my last conscious moment; trying to delay getting off to work and wondering how I will look when I get there; dreading the day ahead of me. I'm quite sure that I don't miss these things am I not?..Meditation for the Day...You cannot believe in God and keep your selfish ways. The old self shrivels up and dies and upon the re-born soul God's image becomes stamped. The gradual elimination of selfishness in the growth of love for God and your fellow human beings is the goal of life. At first you have only a faint likeness to the Divine but the picture grows and takes on more and more of the likeness of God until those who see you can see in you some of the power of God's grace at work in a human life...Prayer for the Day...I pray that I may develop that faint likeness I have to the Divine. I pray that others may see in me some of the power of God's grace at work.
