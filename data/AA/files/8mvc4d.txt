Hey guys the title of this post kinda tells you what I'm posting for. Forgive me please if this is a question asked a lot I'm new to this sub and I've been struggling recently. I need to listen to someone else's experience strength and hope as much as I can. Podcasts recs are also accepted. Thanks! :\)

Try looking up icypaa for ypaa speakers. I know some host committees have posted their keynote speakers on their websites.
There's a free app called AA Speakers which I listen to I also listen to speeches I find on YouTube.
Recoveryaudio.org
youtube has a lot of good audio\-only videos of AA speeches.
