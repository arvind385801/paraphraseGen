I'm struggling a bit with this today:  I had someone for whom I've spent the last two years being a supporter and champion of even though she frankly didn't always deserve it elect to shit on me today in a way that isn't going to be recoverable.  It's not on me that she's a disaster but she's left me in a serious lurch and I'm feeling pretty down about it.  Guess I know what I'm going to be calling my sponsor about today!

This is a great opportunity to practice giving it to your higher power. I know it's tough but what's done is done. You can either be miserable over it or give it to your higher power and get on with your day. 
Today's expectations are tomorrows resentments......  . I found through multiple sets of steps that my high expectations of others set me up to be disappointed and usually end up in resentment... Now I don't expect anything from people especially in AA.... I look to see what I can bring to the group not what I can take
You know what they say "no good deed goes unpunished".
