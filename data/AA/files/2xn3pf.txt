I am a lurker I rarely voice any opinions or comments but I want to make sure people struggling know there is a way out...I can remember where I was anxious about going to sleep because I couldn't drink. Days where repeating a mantra that I wouldn't drink today like a broken record of my thoughts. At times this would occur well into my first few rounds as if there was a disconnect from my mind to my physical body making it impossible for my to will my hand to not pick up that glass.  These memories are just a few that make me grateful to be here today...All it took was: honesty about myself; open-mindedness and accepting that the way I was living was not conducive to being healthy or happy; and the willingness to follow some simple steps under the direction of someone who cared more about my life then my opinions. ..Again thanks.
