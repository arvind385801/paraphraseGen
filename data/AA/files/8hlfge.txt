I am very thankful that I have a solution in my life. I relapsed about a year ago and I remember the hopeless feeling I had. I'm glad I made it back to the rooms and worked the program thoroughly and honestly. It's been a rocky year but I've always managed to stay positive through what I have been going through..Trust god clean house and help others..Today I no longer need to walk in the shadows. Thank you so much!
