I really don't mean to plug my podcast here but the last episode of my podcast reminded me just how grateful I am to have gotten sober through the rooms of AA. If you're looking for an honest horrific feel good podcast to listen to this one may help. My buddy ben and I both suffered from severe addiction and alcoholism and ended up getting sober at the same time. You can find episode 12 with ben Webber of the JAKE HENDERSON PROJECT on any platform. ..https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-jake-henderson-project/id1308334506?mt=2&amp;i=1000406310640
