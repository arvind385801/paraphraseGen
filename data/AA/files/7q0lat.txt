i guess i've had my last drink on wednesday night thursday morning i paid my bar tab thursday night i got off the train to visit my brother. after eating with him at a restaurant i began to experience sever anxiety and paranoia. i can't tell him i relapsed too ashamed and don't want the lectures. i had to hang out with him for about 7 hours and it was hard when i just wanted to be home drinking water. so i got home and ate some noodles laid down and just started feeling like death. i closed my eyes to see faces and scary eyes looking at me. i can't hardly explain it. i am sorry i am just rambling here to make things make sense to myself. today around noon i finally felt like i wasn't insane. but for a while there i was in a very bad mental state. thank  you

Have you gone to any meetings?
To address the scary eyes/faces looking at you you might be having hallucinations? I know when I was drinking I had some pretty crazy dreams accompanied by sleep paralysis heart palpitations and eventually a seizure. Fuck alcoholism...I would suggest seeing a doctor and going to a meeting. Even if you leave the meeting and drink you are always welcome back. The only requirement for AA membership is a desire to stop drinking.
Don't forget the comedown.   Your mind will play games it'll be different next time.  Get help daily help.  Good luck. 
See a doctor.
