I'm at about 4 and a 1/2 years sober now.  My life has really come full circle and gratitude is a normal practice for me.  But with the daily struggles of life and new goals in my head although I still want to stay away from alcohol I sometimes forget the significance of my sobriety.  Today wasn't a remarkably good or bad day but for some reason I really felt grateful to be sober.  I really saw my sobriety for what it is - a gift and a miracle.  For me at least for today these aren't just empty words - I am truly grateful to be sober.  And as long as I'm sober anything else is possible...And it just so happened that after I started thinking that way my day started going really well.  I guess it already was going well - I just started to realize and appreciate it...Thanks folks.

Congratulations! Thanks for sharing your thoughts. My life is changing for the good every day thanks to sobriety and the gifts of AA. I'm fairly new to the program and I deeply appreciate the inspiration from you and others who have stayed on the path in spite of adversity. 
Thanks. I need see and hear this over and over. I am just a bit over two months in and the last few days have been amazing and I am terrified of losing it.
