I hope you have a support system. Go to a meeting if you can. 
Alcohol us cunning baffling and powerful. We are all just one drink away from where you are so just realize we are also here to help you. We know what it's like as we were once there. .

Hang in there. You will be okay. Get to a meeting and ask for help.
I remember spending an afternoon in a motel room with a bottle on the first day of my last relapse. Sitting on the bed edge drinking and crying because I didn't want to drink. It was the beginning of a gray and dreary 8 months. ..Seize any little chance that presents itself to make it back to this side. Hope you come back and that you stick.
If an asthmatic has an asthma attack should we shame him? If someone has a worsening of their gout should we tell him he is bad?..Your crisis is bad in the sense it was life threatening. It was bad in the sense something wasn't working in your recovery. It isn't bad in the sense you are bad...When one is relapsing the big thing is to interrupt the relapse. Shame and bad feelings have some limited value but we almost always overdo them. Move towards the light.
I'm going through the same nightmare myself. Remember how you feel now tomorrow is our 1st day of recovery. Let's do it together.
