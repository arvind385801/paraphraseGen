Drinking is something I've been struggling with for about two years. I don't want to be this person.

I have a really hard time looking at this objectively.
If you are willing to close the door in your mind that leads to drinking and fully commit to sobriety then there is no reason you can't find what you seek. Go to an A.A. meeting and let go of the alcoholic need for control and doing things your way and surrender yourself do it their way. Sounds like doing it your way hasn't worked but doing it he A.A. way works for even the heaviest of drinkers. Get a sponsor (just let them know that you are looking for one) go to meetings read their book work the Steps with your sponsor. And do the things you need to do every day to stay sober. It's all there for you but rather than criticize the process or just pick out the parts that suit you stop swimming against the current and go with the process. Your struggling will end.
Wants can be relative. They count only if your want causes you to act for your benefit. If you're home tonight instead of in a meeting the want you feel is meaningless.
You are not alone.  There is a seat in AA for you too.  You deserve a better life.
Only you know when it's time and only you can take the next actions. ..Why did you post here? What are you looking for?
I'm not ready I've been drinking the last three nights this week. I'm not ready. I'm a little disappointed in myself.
