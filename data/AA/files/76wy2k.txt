I even hear it in a dumb voice.  In my head.  I typed it "oh relapse is inbound" in the voice of a great let's-play person.  But then I have to work so I've been steady and just... I'm.. I have Tuesday evening off Wednesday off and Thursday off..  this is going to be the period I need the most help and the most "attaboy!" compliments.  I think that feels petty and stupid... but seriously... you guys don't know my dad hah...Anyway... I have been home and relaxing.  I can't sleep.  It's all nightmares night sweats and night tremors from the 7-8 days ago and I am trying to detox.  I guess I am doing good as all my employees STILL say I am A+ and the best and I do so much...But this weekend is coming and I think I will fail... but... because I think I will fail am I allowing myself to fail? (Oh you KNOW you are weak drink screw up) but I don't know.  I have no faith in me and I know in some places that's "self grandising" or something but seriously... Thursday at 9PM at my local church near the Kroger there is Alcoholics Anonymous and I will go.  I will go.  My dad insulted me the only time he saw me about that.  "Will you show up to AA drunk" and I said "Yes.  If they send me away well I made a chance but otherwise they're people who're helping"..Sorry I'm just spewing a bit but with zero friends I have tons to spew but nothing to listen to.  Sorry.

Are there a lot of meetings in your area? I challenge you to go to one meeting a day until your next shift and tell people where you're at. Don't make relapsing plans. Work on staying sober for the next 5 minutes. Good luck bud. I promise being sober isn't as shitty as it seems right now
Consider hitting meetings with the same frequency that you drank as at the beginning they are your only substitute for alcohol. Later on you'll hopefully have other stronger support that you'll develop but right now deciding to have light contact is an error. Show up early to your groups and shake some hands. Let them know you are new. Start collecting phone numbers of members of your gender. Consider using those (that's their purpose) when a drinkie starts to look like a good idea. Sleep will straighten out as you go longer without a drink.
