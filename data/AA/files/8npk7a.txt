Hi guys my name is Joe and I'm an alcoholic. ..I've gone six months without drinking after years of drinking heavily every day. I'm 30. ..In early January I quit drinking with the help of a rehab program. Since leaving rehab I've felt almost no desire to drink despite almost all the worst things that can happen in a person's life...I got heavily into lifting weights and genuinely enjoyed it. I lost 40 lbs built muscle and look pretty damn sexy if I say so myself. ..I mended relationships started a new career path and I'm doing well at both. ..On Monday night I decided to drink. It felt very random. I had lost the fear of drinking and I think it had been in my subconscious for a few days. So I got a bottle. ..Anyway I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would but it was fine. And then I puked in my sleep. The cumulative hangover has knocked me totally off my axis. I've drunk each night since then and I can't believe the difference in how I feel. Physically I have no energy and my mood has been in the gutter. ..I'm stopping the cycle early this time because it's been driven home to me once again that the minor high isn't worth the major physical and mental depression that follows. ..I hope you guys don't mind if I post a victory lap update when I don't drink tomorrow night...

Same thing happens with me to be honest it's encouraging to know the payoff is worthless. Good luck today was today tomorrow starts the rest of your life. 
That's ok just don't drink today. You know you can do this. Have you considered AA. The rooms saved my life.
I'm sorry you had to go through that and am looking forward to your update tomorrow.  Have you tried AA?  I have been going since I stopped drinking and I've found such a great support system in the rooms. 
I'm sorry you had a slip but I'm glad you have the strength and courage to share and reach out for help. Have you been attending AA during your 6 months? 
This is a progressive illness. I keep myself immersed in AA I don't ever want to drink again.
Get back on that horse! You know what to do.  You can do this. Good luck.
Hi Joe.
[Daily Reflection May 26](http://www.recoveryreadings.com/dailyrecoveryreadingsMay26.html) ..Hang in there man I had a very similar story in which I was rocking my initial sobriety much like you were and then I randomly drank.  I had multiple small setbacks over the next two years as alcohol to me was everything literally I thought it was the answer to all of my problems.  I clearly was delusional lol but aren't we all:) It took time to learn how to cope with most aspects of life.  ..Anyway I love the May 26 reading as it let's me take a deep breath and realize that I can make mistakes and use that to better myself.  I now have one year and four months today and I'm feeling real good and rocking a solid AA program...Hang in there man!  We're all here with you  
You got a little too comfortable there. When I have feelings like that I like to drive by my local jail. That helps me remember where I was and what my life was like. It helps snap me back into reality. I'm glad you made it back. Best of luck. Hit the gym and wear some of that alcohol out of your system.  
I'm only a month in on my first real attempt at not drinking I know I can't ever become a drinker again I also haven't had the urge to drink yet. ..The other night I took two small shots with my wife cause we were at a concert that we've both been looking forward to it was just a little celebratory deal the drinks weren't enough to even give me a buzz. But the next morning the itch was back it was really weird feeling the addiction creeping in on me like that after only two shots. I think shit like this are humbling reminders we need to really show us that we can't drink. Im just looking at every day like Day 1. If I get years in it'll always be Day 1. ..Don't beat yourself up about a slip up just be happy you didn't convince yourself you can drink or that you fully fell back into it. 
Welcome back! I just slipped/relapsed myself after 9 months sober. I feel like someone else overcame me and then next thing I know I'm at home drunk with my husband and mom. I know I made the choice but it really feels surreal. I had a mental break earlier this month and just haven't felt the same since. Then I ended up drinking...It's scary how letting my guard down caused this. I completely agree that it's not worth the mental anguish. The past week I've felt defeated sick cloudy guilty apatheticetc. The fallout has not been worth it at all but now I'm thinking about alcohol again and thinking of sneaking...I don't want the thoughts but they are back...We've got this! I will not drink with you today. 
A guy in a meeting yesterday said he just had to touch the stove and yes it's still hot. .Welcome back!
A victory lap for not drinking g for a day after a relapse? .   Look that's great that you haven't drank in a day. I noticed you didn't say a single thing about AA in your post. Well this is an AA sub so the advice would probably be go to a meeting sit down and listen get the book Alcoholics Anonymous get a sponsor and work the steps. That's what AA is. .  You'll probably feel better posting this in r/stopdrinking. They will be happy to tell you how amazing you are having not drank for a day pat you on the back and tell you you've got this. .   That's not what AA had done for me. I learned the truth here: if I drink? I die. So I'd better do something about it. All this  I won't drink with you today  nonsense doesn't cut it for an alcoholic like me. I see people say that shit over and over while drinking the entire time. Getting a day... 2 days... a week.. then bam. Out again wondering what happened. .   If you are like me staying sober takes work. Not victory laps and endless congratulations. That's like someone throwing me a party for not playing Russian Roulette today. .  Don't drink. Go to AA and listen for a while. Maybe you'll be a lucky one and live through this thing?
