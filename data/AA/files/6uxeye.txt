I'm struggling and need some support today. I'm trying so hard to stop and just need someone.

Can you make a meeting?
Sure what's up?  I can't believe I'm just sitting here again doing nothing when part of me really really wants to you know ... "have a life" and stuff.  What's your struggle today?.
It gets better.  I completely fucked myself up with alcohol.  Well done on getting into recovery early.  That booze is sadness.  
First off... Are you from detoxing or from emotions??? ..If you are detoxing you need to go to a hospital right away. Don't fill around cause you could have a heart attack from the withdrawals...If you are shaking from emotions (coming out of your skin) then call your local intergroup or anyone you have a number for and get to a meeting...There is no reason to be alone. ..Also... You can go to meetings online through a site called intherooms.com...Also... Some AA apps have online or face time meetings in them. See if there is one for your area... If not I know the NA app has online meetings in it. Yes I know this is an AA subreddit but I would rather give you all the options I know of. It doesn't matter what fellowship you go t at the moment... The important thing is to NOT be alone and not pick up. God bless.
You can do it - get thee to a meeting! Stat!
800-662-HELP
Google your local AA intergroup and call it!
