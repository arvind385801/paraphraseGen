Things to NOT do if you don't wanna relapse..1) stop calling / visiting supportive and sober people..2) give up on mindfulness only thinking about your bad past and giving up on the future..3) believe all those terrible names you've been called in the past..4) stop exercising even walking as often..5) eat a lot of carbs and sugar (sweet tooth is linked with alcoholism I don't know if anyone else has this but my relapses definitely start with lots carbs/sweet food for a few weeks) ..6) believe you are worthless even though those around you tell you otherwise ..7) forget your goals hopes and dreams..8) forget all the wonderful support you have..9) forget how hard you have worked and how amazing you are ..10) forget that you have had difficult life in one way or another... And that you are sensitive and deserve respect from others and from yourself ..This might be cheesy as f and probably wrong for many people but yeah I guess that's me right now. Be better than me. Sending love ....

How do you know you're mid-relapse?  When you getting back at it?  Drink can kill so get back to recovery today.  
Have you worked the steps in the past?
Get off reddit.  Go to treatment.  Go to a meeting.  Call someone.  I don't know what you wrote because it's been deleted but there are plenty of examples of what not to be out there.  I doubt we need another one.  Go sort yourself out.
