After a little over two years of sobriety I have crossed off all but one name on my list of making amends.  Due to the circumstances of my relationship with that person I can't send them the letter I wrote but I felt the need to share it with the universe. I hope whoever reads this gains something useful and or relatable. ..Dear _____..About two years ago I ended up in rehab and have been sober since January 2016. Part of being sober and in AA is working the 12 steps of the program. One of these steps is an amends step and that's what I'm attempting to do here. I have debated with myself for a while now on if I should send this to you or not. I don't want to cause any problems in your life I see you are happy and I want that for you. This is not a letter proclaiming undying love and its purpose is not to disrupt your relationship. This letter is my apology to you for all the wrongs I committed against you. I accept responsibility for my harmful behaviors directed towards you...I behaved in a self-centered manipulative selfish and unkind manner. You remained true to your character and over-looked my problems more times then I care to admit. I complained about not having enough of your attention when it was all you were giving. I should have thanked you but instead I complained. I shared what should have been private between us with others when I knew better and caused a lot of embarrassment for you. When you were trying to keep it together I was doing everything I could to cut the cord. I did not dare believe in your dedication or give you the trust you rightfully deserved. It must have been so frustrating for you.  I regret not cherishing you when I should have and could have but am happy that you have found someone who does. You deserve it...In truth I was unhappy with myself and wondered what you were doing with me. I am truly regretful for the way I treated you. You did not deserve unkind treatment; you were the bright spot in my life. I just never told you. I was selfish reckless drunk high or hung over far too often and because of this behavior I wasn't a good friend or romantic partner to you and I'm very sorry for that. Deep down I wanted to be and that's why I struggled so much but my intentions don't count here. I'm sorry for every single time I drank too much. Every single time I did any drugs. Every single time I was hung over and not available to you. Every single time I choose getting drunk and/or doing drugs over you or our relationship or any plans we made. I'm sorry for every single time I embarrassed you or made it hard/uncomfortable on you in any way. There were times when you with good reason would call me  out  on my poor behavior and I would argue with you or try to push the focus on you or try to justify my actions. I was wrong. Dead wrong. I apologize...I would like to thank you for giving me a chance when nobody else did for sticking by me and for always being there for me no matter what. A person like you is irreplaceable. After all that you have done for me and I wish I could say the same for myself to you. What really sticks with me is that you above everybody else always saw the potential in me and the person I could become. I applaud your will to tolerate my lowest of lows and my highest of highs because God knows they are so different. No matter what happens please know that I am sorry and I wish nothing but the best things for you including happiness with a woman that deserves you...Sincerely.S
