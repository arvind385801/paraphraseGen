Done. Good luck!
Done.
There ya go...  Side note: (Recovering mormon here as well.)  I can help you recover from being mormon OP if you need.  :)
good luck!..remember in your app that there exists several different 'models of recovery' and you should ensure that your app doesn't automatically assume that cognitive behavior therapy (the bit with triggers and relapse/stress prevention) is the only way to help people.  leave a little wiggle room for people who follow different recovery paths.
So is this survey only for those who went through some kind of treatment center/hospital? ..RE:..Have you been in treatment for addiction (both inpatient or outpatient)?
When you ask about "where you are" are you referring to physical location or emotional state?
