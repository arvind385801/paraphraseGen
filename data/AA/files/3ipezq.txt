I had a relapse. I've been on a hard binge the past few days. I'm also a drug and sex addict and I did that shit too. I'm trying to not feel the comedown fucking skin crawling shit. ..Shit aint even fun anymore. Just high to high using sex to not feel the shakes. I feel like I can't stop moving or something. Just trying to not come down. But I did some bad shit. I feel fucking disgusting. I'm not sure if this is the right place to vent and if not sorry. ..There's a meeting later tonight but I'm kind of ashamed to go there. I get that hot feeling in my limbs feel shaky. Just doing it now to avoid that comedown fuck. ..I don;t even know what I'm doing writing this I don't want to be some fucking sob story or some shit I don't know. Maybe someone's gone through this shit too I don't know. I'm sorry.

Go to that meeting....contrary action is key.  Remember you can't save your face and your ass at the same time.  Stay strong.
Go to the meeting. You won't be the last or first who got there drunk or hungover. I was mostly drunk the first three days. 
Men and women drink essentially because they like the effects produce by alcohol. The sensation is so elusive that after a time they cannot differentiate the truth from the false.
You would not be the first person to go to a meeting at least slightly damp...I know that because I was the first one to do that. And it was over 20 years ago. Yet here I am still sober.
