If you keep using phrases like "Last time" and "This time" to describe your stints of sobriety there will be a"Next time" relapse. ..Say "from now on". "From now on" I will take the suggestions given to me. "From now on" I will work the steps. "From now on" I will go to my home group everyday. "From now on" I will get involved with the fellowship...Changing the way you talk to yourself is the first step in changing the way you think and act.

Avoid the word 'should'. 
It's always kinda bugged me.  Although I've heard people say if you say "I will never drink again" than you probably will
