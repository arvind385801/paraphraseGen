2 years sober but I'm struggling to accept certain things and it seriously disturbing my serenity. Most of the issues are work related and run the gamut of usual complaints. I know that the disturbances I feel are being caused by my failure to accept people places things and situations as being exactly how they are supposed to be today. ..The question is HOW do I accept these things? Any advice on the steps to take?

Honestly. Speak with your HP
Good question. Practice humility. Think about others more often. How would the other person feel. What is their perspective. Another big one for me was reading "acceptance is the answer" in the big book. The last few pages of that story are now part of my daily readings. Here is a short snippit https://thisimperfectjourney.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/acceptance-is-the-answer/
Sitting here with my sponsor of 30 years. I asked him just now and without missing a beat says "By doing it"
I use the Serenity Prayer:..&gt;Grant me the serenity to accept things I cannot change;..&gt;Courage to change the things I can; and ..&gt;Wisdom to know the difference.
Have you ever tried meditation? My acceptance muscle was strengthen when I got into 1) mindfulness meditation 2) self compassion meditation .I use free guided meditations and listen before I go to bed. At first the practice of meditating was like pulling teeth! Now it helps bring awareness to my breath and is very calming. I will look up a few links and can attach them in another post. I hope this is useful. Acceptance is hard and for me it's an on going work in progress.

Acceptance is not the answer to all my problems. ..Most often I've found that finding the courage to change is what is needed rather than seeking acceptance. ..Recently a friend in my home group found that he had the same work related resentment coming up over and over again in his inventory for months. So he quit the job and got a better one. Resentment gone!..Some situations in life require acceptance. But the wisdom of experience shows me that most often I need courage. The courage to face problems take action and make changes.
