15 years ago I worked at a residential treatment facility so I dragged a lot of surly teenage boys to these meetings. I knew the steps the traditions the literature the pamphlets the Rocky Horror audience participation ("Sponsor? What's that!?!" "You're in the right place" "...could and would if he were sought.")  Even then I drank too much but it was my familiarity with the program that kept me away. It was obvious the members doing the talking didn't think a person could succeed without a higher power that was supernatural. There's a lot of religious people and a lot of "Not really religious but more ya know like spiritual?" people. It could be whatever you believe in as long as it's some sort of intelligent force! If you can't hack that let the group be a stand-in for your higher power because if you work the steps you'll believe in a supernatural God soon enough or you've done something wrong and you will probably fail. (That's all right there in the Big Book. Yeah I've read that. Also that horseshit We Agnostics section.) I squandered my 20's drinking and never thought to use AA as a tool because it is clearly not meant for me...It's still not...Now that I'm giving AA a shot I am finding strength in the fellowship. These people are my people and I'm one of them. I know I'm in the right place.  When people talk they tell my stories. They describe feelings and thoughts I have. The people and the literature have this dark snarky sarcastic sense of humor forged in pain but lit by hope. Some of them even seem to understand my disbelief and give me helpful encouragement like "Hey take what you can use and leave the rest" but others dismiss it with "Yeah it's okay you don't believe now. Because you're gonna."..I'm in the right place. I struggle to reconcile living a life of "rigorous honesty" while paying lip service to a God I don't believe in in 6 and a half of the 12 steps. "Fake it till you make it" is a clever rhyme but step work isn't about imagining a god and talking to it like some sort of celestial therapist. We are supposed to beseech this God to act on our behalf. It's not "imagine a person and try talking to it" but "imagine a chair and try sitting in it."..I understand that Tradition #3 could not be more clear about what it takes to be a member but while being welcoming to atheists and agnostics a lot of the literature and a lot of the people are patronizing and dismissive of us. Every "atheist" and "agnostic" referenced in the literature somehow seems to end up finding God lo and behold...I've heard many times "Oh it's not what you think. It doesn't have to be an anthropomorphic God like the bible with a robe and a beard." As if my disbelief in god is due to beards...Then there's the word games where god can be whatever I want it to be like love or nature which is fine but once we've decided I believe in those things we say "Okay so that's god! Now that we've figured out you believe in God now believe it can restore you to sanity!" I can't ask nature or love for stuff. And frankly turning my life over to nature is what got me into this mess...One guy suggested I write down all the qualities I'd want in a higher power... then believe in THAT!  That's like saying "Alright so she's got Tina Turner's legs Michelle Obama's arms Susan Sarandon's brain Christina Hendricks face hair and boobs AAAAAANNNND that's my WIFE NOW!"..Equally absurd to the "make up a god and believe in it" is "It could be a doorknob or a fire extinguisher as long as you believe in it's power to remove your shortcomings and restore you to sanity."..If I don't think an omnipotent deity is going to restore my sanity why would I think a light bulb will FFS? Are y'all muthaf*ckas even listening to yourselves?  Anybody who says crap like that clearly takes their faith for granted and must find it baffling how someone could deny something so obvious as the existence of a loving God. These are same oblivious people who ask if I worship myself why I'm unwilling to give up my power or why I'm mad at God. ("Oh I'm fine with god but one of his followers is kind of pissing me off right now.")..I'm glad there are a few atheist and agnostic meetings in my area so I can vent about this stuff and hopefully find a sponsor who can help me with this stuff but man some of those other meetings make me feel out of place. Much like taking my first drink of the night is like rolling the dice on what will happen going to a random meeting is like rolling the dice of how much "God stuff" I'll have to hear about that hour.  I've learned to keep quiet because nothing gets people talking to you about god like mentioning you don't believe in one...See I'm already getting good at faking it. G.O.D. my loving Group of Drunks...In the literature it graciously concedes that a stubborn atheist such as myself can use The Group as a placeholder for a higher power if I must...Fuck that...You are not a runner up prize. You are not a crutch I can rely on until I learn to believe in intelligent mystical forces like a NORMAL person. You are not a placeholder for my higher power...YOU my fellow alcoholic are powerful. ..Your power is in your stories your love for me your desire to see me do well and your pain you are brave enough to share with me. This power of yours gives me strength that I cannot muster on my own. ..Your power is in your acceptance of me because we're all there with one goal even if my path looks different than yours. (Even those of you who aren't great at that. You're still mostly nice and well-meaning!)..Your powerful cheers and claps feed the hole where my soul isn't when I mumble my name and the number of days I have. ..You are powerful when I look lost in the hallway of a church I've never been to before and you ask if I'm there for the AA meeting. With a wink you say "Follow me you're in the right place." (In the right place! Get it? Like the saying from the meetings!?!)..You with high bottoms are powerful for letting me know I don't need to sink further to belong here and get help...You with low bottoms are powerful for giving me vivid "yets" to remind me why I don't drink. (Plus we all know your shares are the best.)..You old timers with thirty-something years are powerful...You newcomers in your first second or third meeting brave enough to introduce yourself are powerful...You newcomers who are AGAIN in your first thirty days are powerful...You are powerful for being a room full of people who stopped drinking with varying degrees of success because I want what you have and you have the power to help me...You ARE powerful and I needed to tell you that. Both as a reminder to me because there are those who try to tell us otherwise and as gratitude to you because you deserve it. Don't let it go to your head because most of us are as bad at handling our egos as we are at handling our liquor. You just by knowing what we're going through and loving us anyway are someone's Higher Power...So try not to shit on that alright? I may never believe in a spirit or feel it wake up but if I live sober and find serenity am I really doing it wrong?..30 days today. That puts my sobriety date at April 1st.  That's just so damn perfect I think I'm gonna keep it...TL;DR.Atheists succeeding in the program please commiserate and more importantly offer advice..Atheists irritated with the program you are not alone..Everyone else succeeding in the program please feel appreciated and offer advice too if you want but I've probably heard it and it probably didn't help much.
----------immediate responses--------

I'm at 45 days myself completely atheist/agnostic my whole life before going into the program. 4 months ago I knew my drinking/depression was becoming a problem and I went to a counselor to ask for help... (my university provides 4 mental health counseling sessions free of charge.) ..The counselor didn't tell me much but she recommended going to an AA meeting. ..I was pretty pissed off I wanted a quick solution to my problems and I knew AA wasn't for me. How the fuck is "turning my will and my life over to the care of God" going to do anything? What god? Who's god? How do I turn myself over? This all sounds like a bs cult. ..I decided to quit drinking on my own. I created this problem I'm going to fix it...2 months later I was arrested for a DUI...I saw it coming months in advance but I was too stubborn to do anything about it...I called a lawyer the next day. He told me my best option was to get deeply involved in the program before my court date and prove to the judge that I'm trying to help myself. ..So I go to a meeting and immediately everybody wants to help me out nobody let me isolate myself. Men and woman asked me for my phone number and they started calling me everyday somebody offered to pick me up for a meeting every night...This was when I was expecting them to try to convince me to "find Jesus." ..But they didn't. My sponsor taught me that it didn't matter what I believed in as long as I believed in something. It could be the G-O-D (group of drunks) or anything that worked for me. ..My sponsor has a friend that prays to Morgan Freeman and listens to his answers no shit...This comment was way longer than I wanted it to be so I'll wrap it up. ..I've been praying to a different god goddess entity or celestial object every time I pray. The results are always the same...The act of praying or meditating is actually really helpful for me. I don't really know why it helps but it does....TLDR: Am an agnostic never prayed before AA. Praying to any random thing helps me stay sober and happy. The ritual and willingness to believe are more important than the god.
When I was trying to do the whole HP thing I got really stuck.  REALLY REALLY stuck. ..Then I  'heard' a gentle whisper: .**The Spirit of Christmas** ..I thought... Huh!  Ok...let me look at that.  And thought about it and then heard:..**Get into the spirit of things!**..My Higher Power is **The Spirit of Good**..No more.  No less. In meetings I call him God so people don't look at me funny.  When we're alone  I call him Max.  ..My sobriety date is also April 1st.  Didn't plan it that way.  It just is. It is definitely a keeper.  I celebrated 22 years sober on April 1st. It makes me grin when I  see others with that sobriety date.  It's a good one! 
r/deism..r/pantheism 
Hello nice to meet you and good job reaching out.  I'm 4 years in the program and also atheist.  ...Firstly congratulations on your 30 days.  That's a huge accomplishment and I hope you feel proud of yourself....I understand how you feel; many of us felt the same way when we first began working the program.   I still don't believe in a supernatural being; but I do now understand the Higher Power concept in AA...In a nutshell it is surrender of control.   ..What I've learned in the program is that if I follow the action plan (steps) to the best of my ability my life and well being will improve and I will no longer feel the need to drink...On the flip side if I try and control my own recovery following only the path I feel is the right one and dismissing the experience of others then I may be sober but I am not content or at peace and the desire to drink is a constant battle....Why is that?   I don't know.  But I tried it my way for over a decade and failed every time.  However the first time I really committed to the program I have found success....Again I don't know why this is the case.  And more importantly I don't need to know anymore.  I have surrendered my control over to.... well I don't know.  My HP I guess?  ..My HP is whatever it is that unites us alcoholics. Whatever it is that  unlocks the desire to live a better life and to help our fellow who is suffering.  Because this is a very powerful thing indeed.  You can see it in action at every meeting....My advice to you would be to take a step outside of yourself and ask these questions: .."What is this internal debate I'm having over the existence of something that can't be proven doing for me?" .."What am I gaining by trying to dissect and challenge certain aspects of a proven recovery plan?"..."Would I feel better if I could just let it go and live in the moment instead of up in my head trying to quantify the concept of HP?"...I've learned that I have a tendency to live up in my head.  Reliving the past worrying about the future and often stuck in revolving thought patterns trying to figure out ways to control every aspect of life.   ..But when I throw up my hands and admit that all my thinking and worry won't change a thing.  When I surrender control of the future and live in the now.  I come down out of my thoughts and I feel better.   I call this action giving it over to my HP....It took awhile fr me to grasp this concept.  And awhile to put it into practice.  But the old timers were right.  I have come to believe not in a Judaeo/Christian god or some sort of supreme being....Simply in a power greater than myself.  And that's (thankfully) enough...
For me personally the higher power I believe in is the people in the rooms and the program itself. I get that people are fallible and that you can't put all your faith in just one or you'll inevitably be let down at some point. But in my experience it's been folks in the rooms and working the steps that's helped restore me to sanity and work on overcoming my defects of character and all that. When I pray it's by talking to other alcoholics who have more time than me. If I'm having a problem someone in the rooms usually has a solution for me. It's sort of like that cliche people use for when you're nervous about doing a fourth and fifth step "If there's a name for it it means someone else has done it." I've found that for pretty much anything I'm going through there's someone in the rooms that has dealt with it or something similar and can give me advice on what I should do to get through it without picking up. ..I don't know I've only got a little over 19 months now. But so far this has worked for me. .My sponsor still tells me I need to pray about things if I come to him with a problem but he also offers advice to go with that and he's taught me to call sober supports and share at meetings if I'm going through something. My sponsorship family is very big on fellowship and it's saved my life more than once. Good or bad I know I'm not alone. And that's a form of god reliance in my eyes. 
Here's a version of the steps without the god-stuff:..________________________________________..Step 1: I'm in a mess and over my head...Step 2: Maybe I don't have all the answers . so I'll ask for help...Step 3: Decide to pay attention to advice given. ..Step 4: Take an honest look at how I've been living my life...Step 5: Tell someone else about my unhealthy lifestyle and harm to others. ..Step 6: Decide to live a healthier kinder life...Step 7: Make specific changes toward that goal.. .Step 8: List everyone I have hurt...Step 9: Have the courage to tell them I'm sorry &amp; make amends except if doing so would cause harm. ..Step 10: Keep an eye on myself alert to old thinking and behaviors. ..Step 11: Be aware of the beauty in the world and people. ..Step 12: Pass on to others the kindness extended to me. ..
Here's what I try to pray; "time and reality reveal opportunities to me that I might be useful and productive." that opens my eyes in the morning and keeps me on the lookout. At night I just do short gratitude lists. ..I also struggle with trying to translate everyone's God stuff into a rational message of hope and help but it's often tough to always be translating. I just know with patience and vigilance it'll click for me one day and I'll get it. 
Ayh haha ..The higher power can be summed up in two respects..Acutely your jst accept that your not In control..Wether the magic man makes it so or your nurlogical genetic makeup won't allow it..You have no control over your behavior and obviously no power over others the weather or the stock market..Now beyond that your hp clearly isn't so melovent that your starving in Africa (not sure how ppl can reconcile this anyway but what the heck ) ascribe ultra loving ideals to god hp and try and emulate those not your random will...Tips on emulation are abundantly clear in the big book and from asking people what they do to stay sober..Taking care (loving) yourself and others is the ultimate key
Well done on the 30 days. Keep it going. ..As far as the specifics of member's beliefs I'm equally and entirely uninterested in what members do believe or don't believe. 
Congrats on one month.  Keep doing whatever you are doing and one month can extend into many.  Sorry the God part of AA disturbs you so much.  There are some good Buddhist interpretations of the 12 Steps (just search Buddhist 12 steps) and even a program called Realistic Recovery I believe.  No God required.  Find the recovery program that is comfortable and go for it.  Trying to change AA may just fuel resentments which are not healthy - God or no God.  Imho it's all about the actions anyways and the belief system simply promotes right thinking right practice and right actions.
Thank you for your post it gets me thinking. .All the people that have told you those things that you disagree with have been exactly where you are thought exactly the same thoughts had the same arguments you are not unique you are the same as all of us in this respect. ..Probably there is fear driving your arguments because if I do believe in god I KNOW what the next step is and I'm NOT turning anything over to anybody dammit! Everybody else has had to work through this in their own way as well it is not easy the book tells me that some people choose to make the supreme sacrifice rather than surrender - people have committed suicide rather than do this - that's a pretty strong commitment right there. Do YOU have that kind of commitment? I don't.  I was sitting at the place you are at now and feeling and thinking  like you are and getting more miserable by the day but there was no way i was going to drink again......in desperation I turned to my sponsor who told me of his own disbelief and struggles and first prayer and the results and his incredulity. .Right in front of me was a man who was convinced "against his will" powerful stuff. ..He told me stories of his version of god that were so loving and honest that i found i wanted to believe in them. But I guess I should back up just a little further and remember leaving his house with my brain spinning because I could not believe what he was telling me I did not want to know that i was between a rock and a hard place and it was just going to get tighter and tighter until i at least gave the "god" thing a try...It sounds like you are there you have accepted the group as your "higher power" that is great. One of my sponsors told me " I think of god as my conscience it has always been there I have a choice whether to listen to it or not it has never told me to do something wrong (quite the opposite really)". I like the concept simple easy good...I debated on whether or not to say this reading the first part the angry argument part - ok I get it wow he's really got a lot of them mmmmmmm.......this sounds bad to me...Then the second part was like a different person typing  listing all the good things that you have experienced in A.A. ......wow.....(smile as i read the list)........it's .....right .....there .....in..front of you right in front of your face and you can't see it yet.......all the good things you listed and the feelings you get from them - that's god! right there working in your life already even though you are still struggling...Thanks for letting me share and helping me to stay sober today.
Not necessary to have a higher power but necessary to live by "spiritual principles".
Congratulations on 30 days! Ive got almost 7 years this is my 3rd time since 1993 getting sober. By far the biggest obstacle to making use of the program is the God stuff. I've been able to reframe the concepts for myself and in my estimation my time is as good as anybody else's. ..I am also a human services student aiming to work in addiction treatment services. There are plenty of studies that have determined it is the social support aspect that makes AA successful. The value of sharing experience cannot be overestimated...My "higher power" is philosophy especially the Stoics. I have not been able to sustain a genuine belief or any measure of faith in a god of any stripe. For a good long time I was committed to having my viewpoint considered at many of the meetings I attend but ultimately found it was not worth my time let alone those who had to listen.  .
Thank you. I needed this. Someone who just got done with 5 day binder. I definitely needed to read this as I go pick up a new desire chip tmrw. 
Twenty-nine years atheistically sober in AA/NA/CA.  I believe I got sober through a combination of..* The identification in meetings which broke down my denial and fantasy thinking.* The support from a great sponsor and other members which brought me out of isolation and back into society/community/the human race..* Sharing which took huge courage after having never honestly talked about my inner world/feelings/fears which also brough me back from isolation and started healing..* Seeing others get their life back to together and progress helped my believe it could be true for me to and helped me keep trying through set backs and disasters..* And more if I had the time to dissect them...**My point is that I felt I had a choice of finding a way of making it work for me or dying.** I'd tried every other way I could think of to stop drink/drugs without success...So I had to find a non-supernatural way that worked for me...I also can pick apart what's wrong with reliance on God in the literature but that hasn't helped me and I've felt powerless to change it...What I find fantastic over the last few years is the increase of atheist members worldwide and the community of AA atheists on Internet...I feel hopeful that in another 20 years we may have got rid of the supernatural aspects of the programme. Already newer fellowships such as Teen Addiction Anonymous Computer Gaming Anonymous have changed the steps to get rid of God...I let the religious member get on with their programme and I try be successful with mine. Admittedly I live in an enlightened part of the UK which isn't a fraction as religious as the USA...
