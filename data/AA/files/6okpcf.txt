So I need help. My roommate admitted to me that he's been drinking again. I've never dealt with his before and I'm completely lost. .Background he and I are not friends our families are semi close (it's why we are roomies) however he and I never were friends. We have been living together for roughly a month with everything going well. I knew beforehand that he was in recovery and was doing well with it. He is currently unemployed and I've been trying to help him find a job that he will thrive in. .I had a funny gut feeling the other day that he was drinking again and when he left the apartment I went into his room (you can yell at me later) and snooped around that's when I found all the empties. I calmly left his room and got ready for work. I was fully prepared to come home and talk with him. Talk no accuse just yak and show support. However when I got home he called me to his room and confesses what had been happening. .I was shocked!  We talked for a while about the struggle and I offered support and help. Offered to take him to AA meetings he seemed uninterested in that. .I did explain that I would not tolerate alcohol being drunk in the house (I'm not a recovering alcoholic FYI) and that if I found him drinking in the house I would bring this issue to his parents attention. .I'm totally out of my scope here and was looking for advice on this. Kicking him out I fear would do more harm than good. I'm just not sure if there are additional things I should be aware of or lookout for as I continue to live with him. .I figured it was a good sign that he admitted to me that he had relapsed? .Am I way off base with this? ..Thanks!!
