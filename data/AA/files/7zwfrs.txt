8-10 Years ago I would sit in my bedroom in my mom's attic and think about how I was never going to make it out of that room. I had no real job no money and no direction. My only concern was how to escape everyday through the use of alcohol and other things.  ..I felt like I had no future and I was probably going to end my life in my moms attic. The life I was living just wasn't worth it to me. I saw no real future for myself and it was impossible to see it ending any other way.  I was not going to accept being the drunk son in the attic still asking for his mom to buy him cigarettes. If that was life then I didn't want it. ..In 2010 I called for help and started a new life. God and the 12 steps blessed me with  a second chance. I went back to school found a career and got engaged. Most importantly I became okay with myself one day a time while continuing to build a life over the last 7.5 years. ..Last night we signed papers to buy the house that attic is in. I might die in that attic now but it will be as the owner instead of a burden of a son that won't leave...This house is nothing major. Its a big deal to me obviously but this is what you're supposed to do. I just needed AA to teach me how to live. I post this because if you're struggling pick up the phone there's a new life waiting for you. .

Beautiful! I needed to hear this today. Thanks for sharing it. 
Good on you man. This is such a better way to live. I hadn't had enough until I was 36. In March (God willing) I'll be celebrating five years. It's amazing what has happened in such a short time. Every single one of the promises has come true. Life used to kick my ass. The program has taught me to take action and kick back. I'm about to start my third year as the owner of my own fucking company. Mind blown... Good luck in the new digs. Anybody else reading this take note. He ain't lying. It's a new life. Now get your ass to a meeting.
