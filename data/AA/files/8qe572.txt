I live in a country where meetings are not easily accessible to me (nearest is three hours away). I have been sober for two years but I'm a dry drunk. Not been to meetings or worked the steps or had contact with my sponsor for over a year. I don't even know how to start getting back into it. I'm making excuses yes..I need coping mechanisms. I'm unable to deal with conflict and anxiety and arguments without blacking out with rage and every time thinking this is gonna be the time I drink again. To stop the pain. .I don't know where else to turn. I'm scared of relapsing and I'm scared of being alone.

I'd start by contacting your higher power then your sponsor then going to a meeting even if it's far away. .I'd also start a meeting where you are. 
Intherooms.org online meetings all day long.
I'm right there with ya I'm 9 yrs sober and let my program slide.... I fucking rage at the drop of a hat.....being far from meetings is tough but I know there is online ones you can also help people on here. Reading the big book is always a good start. For me I'm just getting back to basics yes more meetings but AA is a lot more than Just meetings. Im doing a lot more praying "turning it over" reading the literature and trying to live the AA way of life in my everyday living..... Its a start and every bit helps..... 
Where do you live?
You can always start a meeting or talk to another drunk on the phone. Listen to Marie story about early C.A. who's also had to survive on her own in early recovery. ..https://socaconvention.org/past-conventions/soca-2015/
Is it possible to see a therapist? 
Cognitive behavioral therapy with a mental health professional has helped a lot of people in your situation.
