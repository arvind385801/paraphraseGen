Boy am i cheesing today! I've had a shitty day at work BUT I cant believe I have been able to stay sober this long! It is truly a gift that I'm proud to have for 24 hours at a time...I am STILL learning patience and tolerance the hard way but no matter what I dont drink! I've had periods of daily meetings periods of no meetings. Times when I did service 24/7 and not a lick of it- I dont do this perfectly I just don't drink (and try my best not to be an asshole)...The biggest thing I hold on to is that no matter how bad I'm feeling or what I'm suffering through there is another alcoholic who stayed sober through something similar or sometimes worse. They stayed sober to share the experience that it's truly possible to get through ANYTHING and not drink and I mean ANYTHING!..Also for anyone young and struggling- I got sober in college and it is 100% possible to survive your 20s (or any age) stone cold sober and have relationships jobs misadventures travel make mistakes and have victories. It's never too early and it's NEVER too late...Keep trudging and thank you all for being a part of my sobriety today and every day before!
