I was originally written up on charges in the Navy sent to rehab in exchange for dropping those charges. I struggled for the first couple years with identifying myself as an alcoholic getting a sponsor etc. I have also been diagnosed with ADHD and depression gotten married divorced and gone through many life events. All this is life and I am very grateful that AA has given me a chance to live it.
