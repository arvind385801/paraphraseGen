My sponsor relapsed today. I feel like crying. I'm still sober. I just don't know what to do. I don't know....I'm scared shitless.

It happens. Go to a meeting and find another sponsor. It's going to be okay. 
Great reminder of our humanness.  You may be able to help him/her by being there during a tough time.  Definitely keep your own sobriety seat belt fastened tightly.
Ouch. Stay cool and let the shock and dismay subside. Do the next right thing.  .  .I hated it when I witnessed the first relapse close to me but it's now part of how I grow along in my own recovery.  .  .Grace Acceptance Courage Wisdom!
Try to help him/her and get another sponsor. My sponsor relapsed a few years ago but I just got another sponsor.
The natural state of every alcoholic is drunk.  It always comes as a shock when one of us goes back out but it shouldn't eh?  Be there for that alcoholic still suffering.  Extend YOUR hand the way he/she extended his/hers.  It's what we do :)
The first thing I would do is call my grand sponsor.
Everyone has their own path. Your sponsor's not done obviously. And it's so heart-breaking when it happens. I think one of the main lessons here is that our sponsors are guides human guides at that and we really need to avoid putting them on pedestals. Guard your own sobriety first. Find someone else who has what you want and ask them to be your sponsor as soon as possible. 
I know how it feels but there is nothing so bad that drinking won't make it worse. 
don't freak out. trust yourself. there are no guarantees in life. you won't die without this person. rely on your own strength and start over. good luck.
