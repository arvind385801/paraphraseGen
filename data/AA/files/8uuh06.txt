I'm a teenager who's been dealing with alcohol problems for a while been sober two months while in CD/MD treatment. Is there an AA discord? I'd not there should be! If someone is willing to add me in case of feeling like I want to relapse that would be so incredibly appreciated. Please PM me your Discord if so. Thank you

What's a discord? 
I haven't heard of a Discord being around for AA yet. Your best bet would be finding a meeting in your area if you can. As a young person in recovery also I can say from experience that members will be more than glad to welcome you with open arms and be excited to see someone who's trying to better themselves so early in life!
a disagreement between people ? probably. 
Here you go.  Best wishes!  https://discord.gg/VPkTeZ
On the r/stopdrinking sub there is a chat room linked in the sidebar.  "IRC" it is called ... in real-life chat.? Maybe this is the discourse you are looking for. I wish had the strength to pull away from the clutches of alcohol when I was younger. But like Eminem says in "Not Afraid" (paraphrased) "maybe I had to go to that place to get to this place ". Best wishes. 
I hadn't even thought to look for a discord! Great question! See you in the rooms.
