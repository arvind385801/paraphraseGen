Good Evening Family just wanted to show some love and share my experience. I have struggled with getting clean and sober for years. Put together time went out came back...  Today is my 90th day  ..Something has been inherently different this time around. The steps have been coming to life in my day to day like they never have before. I am starting to realize more about what it means to make this a way of life not something I'm going to get to the end of...If you are just coming back or just coming in don't keep coming back just stay. Find a relationship with something you can believe in. For me that Power is God and I am coming to understand how His infinite Love is creating a beautiful future for all of us...If you are reading this I believe in you. I am blessed to be clean and sober with you today.

One day at a time! Congrats! 
90 is huge! Congrats! One day at a time...**Keep it up!**
It sounds like you're figuring it out. Congratulations.
Awesome! Congrats!..I was in and out of the rooms for 13 years. June 6th 2013 is my sobriety date. I haven't been sober this long since ever...I remember feeling like you're describing. Something was different. I recognized this as a way of life instead of something I would finish. It still is different. I have bad days and good days. But I'm left with a sense that all will be okay. A sense of ease that never existed before. It was different because I came in and I did the work right away. I couldn't do it my way any more. ..It sounds like you're right where you need to be.
