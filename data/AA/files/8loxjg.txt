So awesome!!!
Nice work. Feels good right?! I don't know about you but I'm now starting to reap the rewards I've been sowing for the last 3 months. Safe sober travels!!!
Don't let up go for the gold... Errr the brass!
I love seeing this; proud of you. Just celebrated 10 years last month and still have all my month tokens. I always have at least my most recent token in my pocket at all times. Gentle reminders of the struggles we have gone through to get us where we are in our sobriety. Keep coming back.
That's a beautiful sight!
Congratulations on 90 days. 
Good looking collection there.  Congratulations. Me I carry my 24 hr chip in my wallet because that's all I've got is today. I carry my 2yr chip in my backpack in case I ever want to gaze at it. One day at a time.
