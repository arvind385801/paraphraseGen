Hi all as the title suggests a friend of mine who was sober for over a year relapsed last night...I have no experience in anything like this and so any advice on what we can do to support him would be appreciated...A couple of friends are rotating staying at his house so he isn't alone over the next few days but beyond that we don't know what to do...Thanks in advance I wish you all well!

Good on you for being such a supportive friend! ..A lot of what to do rests on what he wants to do. Is he in a really tough mental state or suicidal? Help him access resources to get help maybe some therapy or just be open to having him talk to you about what he's going through. Does he want to get sober again? Was he going to meetings before he relapsed? It might help to encourage him to go to a meeting or offer to go to an open meeting (they allow non-alcoholics) with him if he wants to get sober again. ..If he doesn't want to get sober then unfortunately there's not much you can do other than make sure he doesn't drink &amp; drive etc..  Good luck! 
Do you know any of his contacts in AA?  Helpful sometimes to reach out and get his support circle engaged...If he doesn't want to stop drinking then either:.1) flee like he's got the plague or.2) paint a target on your forehead (he won't mean to hurt you it's not personal more of a proximity thing).
r/AlAnon..I find myself going to that sub in times like these in my own life to help get ideas because I'm not a pro at dealing with others when they have problems.
I would encourage him to get help - whether that is through a support group or professional help.
