I find myself struggling with anxiety about a job change (new consulting business start-up) and fears of economic insecurity.  Has started to adversely affect my fitness routine.  Also some physiological symptoms like stomach upset.  Any suggestions and ideas from your experience handling anxiety?  No where close to sobriety-threatening thank God!

I've been there and understand the anxiety. It almost made me crazy. Looking back it was a scary time. Like you I never considered drinking knowing that would only make things worse. Are you familiar with meditation? That and yoga helped calm me. I probably said the Serenity Prayer a hundred times a day.
