For me it took AA. I tried to manage my drinking for a couple of years and read the book Moderation Management. I thought it was a solid plan but I needed to meet other people who were going thru the same struggle with drinking I went thru. And I found that in AA..I needed to hear about how they drank because I didn't know other people bargained and made deals with themselves that they kept breaking despite their best intentions...I had no idea I could quit when I walked into that first AA meeting. I wasn't even willing to admit I was an alcoholic. But as the book says "The only requirement for membership is the desire to stop drinking."..I had that...So I decided two things in that first meeting...1. No bargains. For the next 30 days I was going to not drink no matter how good an idea it seemed or what rationale my head gave me...2. I decided to pretend I was an alcoholic even if I didn't want to admit it. And I decided to do what an alcoholic should do in that situation -- get people's phone numbers and go to meetings...It started that simple for me...It can be that simple for you too...You don't ever have to drink again...Today can be that day.

Goddamn youre lucky. I could never do that ever.
Thanks for sharing that. It's nice to hear from people with that much time in the program who still have the desire to give back.
That's amazing. Do you still go to meetings?
