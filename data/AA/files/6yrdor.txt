I'm struggling here and just wanted to I guess vent!  I'm waiting for a friend to take me to an AA meeting.  I guess it's a rhetorical question; we've all been there!  Still it's so easy for me to say (to the guy when he shows up): "Leave me alone!" etc...Yet on the other hand the man coming to my house is my savior!..Pardon me for treating the sub as an AA meeting; I just wanted to say that.

Just try to make it through this day without drinking. Then tomorrow will come and repeat.
Because I have a blank spot in my head that keeps me from seeing the suffering and misery of even a few months ago. The insidious insanity of the first drink will always come. It's like....am I going to be in the middle of the program or on the outskirts when it comes? 
My goddamn instant forgetter hears the most BRILLIANT and INSIGHTFUL thing about staying sober and living a good life and then minutes (sometimes seconds) later completely eschews it so that I can marvel and fantasize about that cold frosty drink that is the cure to all my problems- it's sheer insanity...My only solution so far has been to roll deep with sober friends. I don't make meetings as often as I did when I first got sober but every day I talk to a couple of sober alcoholics about life and share my insanity for the day. It's my touchstone and ensures I call myself out for my insane thinking.
Defense mechanisms that all human beings have are extremely compelling. Denial rationalization repression and others kick in to "protect" the body's and mind's need to numb life's pains...One of my favorite mantras is "the more emotionally involved I am in a circumstance the more distorted my perceptions will be.
It's ok to feel two entirely different ways about something. Just make the best choice for yourself.
