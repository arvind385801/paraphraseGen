I was 2 days shy of 4 months of continuous sobriety. I hit the "fuck it" button and went on an eight day spree.  Thankfully my drinking was ruined by what I had learned in the rooms and 8 days of around the clock drinking was all I could take.  ..I am grateful for the members in AA. A week ago today I sent a message to a member saying I couldn't take it anymore.  Without hesitation they came to get me (even though I was drunk) took me out to dinner and let me talk. I think that's the single nicest thing anyone has ever done for me in my entire life. Thanks to her act of kindness I feel like I can do this sobriety thing and made it back into meetings...I've made it a week so far. My sleep is starting to come back to normal my nerves are settling and my head is clearing up. It does get better with every day I don't pick up a drink...Just thought I would share and wish you all a sober 2-4
