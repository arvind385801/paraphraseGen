My home group has a beginners meeting that's formatted where we have someone chair the meeting and while that person is talking a basket with paper is passed around to write questions to be asked during the meeting.  After the chair is finished they read the questions and answer them or call on others to answer.  It's a pretty good meeting I like the idea.  I would suggest keeping the questions simple like how do I get a sponsor or how many meetings should I go to a week etc.  
This is a great list and I commend you for all the time and effort you put in it.   For me though when I was a beginner I never cared for the  what have we lost  meetings those seemed pretty depressing and had the tendency to turn into the  who lost the most  hour.  What really impacted  me and still does today were/are the meetings that stayed closer to the joys of living sober and the possibilities in life without alcohol.  Stay positive friend!  
Living in constant fear. The feeling that the world was always right about to end. How I don't have to live that way anymore. Fear fear fear. I could have talked about that every meeting at the beginning.
