Hey! You can have this life too. I am seven years sober never relapsed and I am no longer a shitty person. I had a credit score in the high 300s quit jobs every few months drank all the time and I was unreliable. I got a sponser that had a sponser and went to meetings nightly instead of bars. ..Now I have a 4 year degree and I am a teacher full time. Pay is low but I can pay all my bills and my credit score is finally 745! I am reliable and always show up to appointments work and church. I go to meetings weekly but I used to go to several a day...My life is great. I'm not happy about everything but I keep my side of the street clean daily. That is all I can do. Hope this helps someone wondering if they can do it.
