Hello all - so the place I moved into recently I found out the land lady's son is an alcoholic after noticing my bottle of whiskey disappeared from my room. I asked her about and found out he relapsed a few nights ago when I was out of town presumably from my whiskey. I feel awful his relapse was partially due to me but I didn't know at the time and he did go into my room which is in another side of the house. ..Any advice on how to avoid this issue in the future. More importantly how do I talk to him about it? We got along well before the incident and now he avoids any contact with me. I'm not mad about what happened. I understand. I think. ..............

  If he stole money or your car would you feel the same?    You are not at all responsible for his relapse.  It was going to happen with or without your booze.  ....My best advice is to put a lock on your door or find a new place to hang your hat.  If it happened once it can and likely will happen again.    ..As far as talking to him about it.  Just bring it up.  He knows full well what he did and why he did it.  He needs to know that you know too.  Not mentioning it could be taken as tacit acceptance of what he did.  An alcoholic mind can twist this into approval.  Let him know that you're not okay with him coming into your room and stealing your possessions.   It may strain your relationship but it will also serve to help him realize that he needs help.  
People with experience in al-anon might have some good suggestions for you.
