I couldn't believe there wasn't a subreddit for those in sober living so I created it \(new account for all this\). I sure wish I knew how to negotiate it more than when I first moved in. I've been in half a dozen through a couple relapses a couple illegal evictions and other random events. I'm in Southern California but it is meant for everybody...Come join and post. I know everybody in an SLE has plenty to complain about...[r/DruggieBuggy](https://www.reddit.com/r/DruggieBuggy)

Oh the hell with creating a throwaway everyone that matters in my life knows everything about me. I think this is a great idea for a sub. I love my AA meetings but sometimes I need to just vent or talk to someone outside of the stuffiness of AA's rules and regulations. ..Is this what you're intending with this sun to be? An extra outlet for those currently in sober living? ..If I'm reading this wrong let me know and I'll delete my reply.
What is SLE
