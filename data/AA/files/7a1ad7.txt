I see a lot of new folks here and felt it might be helpful to share a bit.  Am going to sort of summarize quickly my experience so far...Started program @ 36 yrs old.  Moderate led to heavy then to daily then to nearly round the clock.  Couldn't continue living with it couldn't imagine living without...Bout of severe DTs and I finally said help...Didn't have any real faith and my only impression of AA was second hand accounts and believing failure rates and discrediting info from the internet.  But doctors and detox said 90 meetings in 90 days.  I was desperate enough now to try anything...I went to a meeting shaking and filled with worry and doubt.  Crawling in my skin. ..I didn't drink that night.  I just had to make it another minute hour struggle.  But tiny glimmer of hope I could last til next meeting. ..Repeat. Brain clearing enough to recognize the real sober people and those struggling. ..30 days.  I keep that chip in my wallet most important moment in my life next to my children's birth.  That serenity prayer I still repeat over and over to fall asleep. ..90 days.  I don't know what is happening but I think maybe this is what a miracle actually is.  It is for a drunk like me...Got a sponsor.  Started meditation told whatever sliver of God I once had that it was time to become something greater.  Infinity.  No more limitations based on crap I thought I knew...Faced step 4 and 5.  The evidence these AAs had something that I couldn't do on my own was there.  DO IT.  Nothing to lose potentially more to gain...Zero obsession to drink. But still dealing with my old selfish ways. My problems fears anxiety reshaped into challenges to grow from and not be avoided...Remaining steps essentially continue as a lifelong process.   Initially though we work through them with our sponsor and fellow alcoholics...Year 1 to now.  Discovering all sorts of different spiritual paths concepts love soul.  Compassion is like fuel now.  I thought service was going to be some kind of chore but really this feeling now is so good I want to help other people suffering feel how amazing it can be to escape the darkness too...My change in thinking and outlook is so vastly different just thinking back on memories is like staring into chaos.  My personal sort of awakening I'd have to best describe as waking up from the Matrix...I am so glad AA washed my damn brain it needed it.  There is more to the story but that's the quick and dirty. ..Failure is only not working the steps as the book suggests.  It's a wonderfully distilled and action based spiritual program.  All the steps and most ideas my ego screamed against doing.  But all I have to do any given day is drink to throw it all away go right back to my old misery.  That darkness is always waiting but today at this moment I have a choice now. ..Just do the next right thing it will all work out...Good luck to anyone willing to try.  Heaven is on this earth we just have a sickness that doesn't want us to see it...MY experience.  Results may vary batteries not included may contain small parts. Peace.

Well said and also my experience...that change inside the problem that brought me in solved satisfactorily the deck cleared to start being real. ..Hope those who've yet to find an answer will attend to your words closely and grasp that progress and resolution results from actions taken instead of intentions and wishes.
Congratulations! Very well said. ..To me willingness and open-mindedness is essential to simply embark on this spiritual journey. Then it's just honest and earnest work. Practice patience and perseverance. Serenity is the reward.
