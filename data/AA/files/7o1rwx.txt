So I moved cross country almost two years ago. I had about a year sobriety at that point and a fantastic sponsor. I started attending meetings in my new city. There is a great recovery community here. I did go several months without going to meetings and relapsed last year. I'm clean again and go to meetings regularly but I know my sobriety is not sustainable unless I get a sponsor and go through the steps again. Any time I get the courage to talk to a woman after a meeting the meeting disperses and everyone goes home before I get a chance and then my courage goes away. I'm definitely ready to get a sponsor and do this thing. I want to be truly sober and not just clean. I miss the serenity and I want to start giving back also. I guess I just need a little encouragement. ..Edit: .Upon re-reading this post I know it sounds like a bunch of excuses. I just need to get over my social anxiety I suppose.

Would it be possible to get to a meeting early and have a word with someone then? Even if its 'fancy a coffee after the meeting?' . That might preempt things for you and facilitate action? 
You could raise your hand during share and announce you are looking for a sponsor.  That is how I got my last sponsor.
