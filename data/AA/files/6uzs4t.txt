Remember this... you don't owe anyone anything. If you ever feel that your sobriety emotional mental and/or physical well-being is in jeopardy in any way... Walk away. And you can do it without giving any explanation to the person...Remember that you are in this program to save your own ass first. No one is going to be in the jail cell or laying in the grave with you when you relapse...Don't let people walk all over you... Don't let them manipulate you... Don't let them control you...Save yourself so you can carry the message to the next person...Learn when to walk away.
