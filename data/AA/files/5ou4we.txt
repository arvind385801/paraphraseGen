So a little background I am a 32 year old male and been drinking heavy since I was about 19 went to rehab two separate times in the last year the latest time being last march. While at that treatment I was playing basketball and felt a pop in my hip/groin and had severe pain shoot down my right leg. I then relapsed after leaving the treatment center and lost my insurance and just got it back at the beginning of January and have been sober off and on. I finally got to the doctor today and found out I have avascular necrosis which means I have had a lack of blood flow to my joints mainly my right hip and it has caused the bone to detoriate. The doctor  said it was caused by excessive alcohol abuse and my only option is a hip replacement or to live in severe pain. Just kind of a shock that I could of done that much damage only being 32 just wondering if anyone has been through this?? Thanks

My dad is currently recovering from this. His lower spine deteriorated and they recently fused together what is left. Modern medicine is a beautiful thing I wish you a speedy recovery. My dad said physical therapy was the worst part. Motivating yourself to recovery could be difficult. Listen to your doctors push yourself to get better. Just don't pick up the bottle it will all be in vain.
