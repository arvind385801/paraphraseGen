My name's Bo I'm an alcoholic...Hello r/AA..I've been in and out of the program. I have "sober" dates in July October December and most recently just short of 2 weeks ago. I have a sponsor and a home group who have welcomed me back after a couple of months of relapse and absence...I realized I have the disease of Alcoholism truly this morning. I drank a whole pot of coffee out of compulsion and got sick. Sure the last time I drank 2 Sundays ago I had only 2 drinks but i was compelled to have twice as much as I planned just as I was compelled to use caffeine to alter my state of mind this morning. ..Thank you r/AA I hope to check in here more and on other subs. Grateful to be here.

Hi and welcome! We're so glad you're here!
Welcome home.  A home group and a sponsor are great actions.  Are you and your sponsor working the steps?
