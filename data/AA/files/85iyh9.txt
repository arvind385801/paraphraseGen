PRAYER: IT WORKS..It has been well said that  almost the only scoffers at prayer are those who never tried it enough. ..  TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS p. 97..Having grown up in an agnostic household I felt somewhat foolish when I first tried praying. I knew there was a Higher Power working in my life how else was I staying sober? but I certainly wasn't convinced he/she/it wanted to hear my prayers. People who had what I wanted said prayer was an important part of practicing the program so I persevered. With a commitment to daily prayer I was amazed to find myself becoming more serene and comfortable with my place in the world. In other words life became easier and less of a struggle. I'm still not sure who or what listens to my prayers but I'd never stop saying them for the simple reason that they work...
