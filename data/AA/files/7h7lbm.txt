So today there was a social situation high stress and everyone drinking. I struggled extremely hard with my 6 + years of sobriety today...All I told myself is if I could just get through today without a drink I could do this. It took everything in me to not take a drink today. But I did it. Once I got home and the stress was relieved and I wasn't right in the thick of it I was so grateful that I was able to make it through the day without drinking.  I no longer feel that clawing need to drink today...One day at a time. That's all you got to do. Hang on till that feeling goes away and the sanity comes back. ..I know you guys can understand how I felt today. It sucked but I made it.

Why do you suppose you felt that way today.  Surely you've been in some similar situations over the past 6 years?  Is it typical for you to feel that way?
I was having difficulty and I read this last night and it help you.
