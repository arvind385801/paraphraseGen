We live in different countries and each have been going through our own issues. ..I started the year with a drinking relapse - one night - but enough to prove I'm an alcoholic and have no  control  after the first drink. ..Quite frankly I didn't tell any of my immediate family members so I wouldn't worry them. ..Anyways I'm FaceTiming with my sister tonight and start to open up about my slip but also that I'm back on track and it taught me a lot. Instead of support she was incredibly critical. I understand that people who don't experience the same thing as me might not get it. .Usually I'm speaking to people in the rooms who can relate to experiences with alcohol drugs etc. ..Still it was an incredibly disheartening and frustrating situation and after a few minutes of her getting down on me I told her I had to hang up the phone because the conversation was making me feel angry. ..Any advice when it comes to how much you share with close friends and family who may not really relate?

The only advice that matters is don't drink over it...I would call my sponsor or go to a meeting but the main thing is don't drink.
One thing I've realized is that it is really difficult to succinctly  explain  why we drink the way we drink to non-alcoholics. You relapsed it happens. Move on and do what you did before to get back on track. If friends/family are inquisitive and want to talk to you about it be open and honest. But remember that they probably won't fully understand like we do. Personally I wouldn't try to force the issue and attempt to explain why it happened. I wish I had more helpful advice but it's kinda one of those things ya know.
