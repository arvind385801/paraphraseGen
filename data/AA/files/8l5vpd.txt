I type this sitting on a beautiful beach in an amazing place with my wife. The last two years have been a real struggle for me. I haven't been able to make it past 5 months. I had four years before but this has been a fight...Like I said I'm on vacation and have no no thoughts or ideas of using or drinking for the past 4 1/2 months. Over the last couple days I've felt rocky again. I've been going to meetings every day and it has been helping me get through it. I am determined to not give up. I can't keep doing this in and out shit. ..My brain keeps telling me that I can smoke weed but I know where it leads every time. Cunning baffling powerful and patient. That's how my addiction works. ..I guess this is more of a check in than anything. Greatly appreciated..I love this sub and appreciate all of you it always helps to realize that I am not alone even on my tough days...Love and Light to all of you
