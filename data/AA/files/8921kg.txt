Hey all I'm actually a little nervous to go today and pick up my one month chip. I posted in SD last week but haven't updated however I lost a parent this week. I quit a couple of months ago and slipped 32 days ago when he was diagnosed. This morning I got a text from a friend congratulating me on 90 and it kind of killed my enthusiasm as I had to reset the clock. I know relapse happens all the time at various lengths of sobriety but man it really blows to reset the clock. I know I need to not beat myself over that and celebrate where I'm at today so I'm trying to pump myself up again before this meeting. Anyway thanks for reading and I hope everyone has a nice day. ..Edit from comment below: It ended up being a wonderful meeting. My great grand sponsor took 25 years and everyone was really proud of me. The woman who introduced me to the meeting presented a chip for me which was lovely. Thanks guys.

You're doing it! Stay positive!
Time is nice but is the quality of your time. Know folks with decades and I don't want a lick of what they have. Other folks with thirty days that just ooze serenity and honesty. Good to hear your 31  keep at it. All we have is today just keep stacking em up. 
you still have all of those days that you lived sober. they don't go away. they were just interrupted and then you got back on track. i have difficulty with the value of counting the days because it sets us up for the exact feeling you have. it doesn't seem exactly sane if it cancels out all the sobriety before it.
There's no way to change it.. I'd just go get it done. You have 30 days and that's a big deal. I reckon in a while provided you stick with it you won't think a thing about it. .  Can't change time so go get a chip! That IS your date right?
