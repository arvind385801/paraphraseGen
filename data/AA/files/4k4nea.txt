Thought this might be a good read. I'm struggling w how to make amends hence my interest peaked. 
----------immediate responses--------

Read the book first...My initial impression was that making amends was a form of apology and that simply isn't true.  My lasting impression is that making amends is correcting damage - wherever we can - without hurting any other in the process.  In some cases this might be an apology making financial restitution correcting behaviour etc..  Sometimes it might not be possible to make amends for one thing or another but we prepare ourselves should the day come when we can...The book explains it best.  I have heard some interesting things around the rooms but for me it all comes back to the book.  This is part of clearing out the wreckage of the past so it doesn't interfere with our new found understanding of things..
Making amends is one of the most rewarding parts for recovery in my experience. If you haven't worked steps 1-8 with a sponsor don't jump into 9. The willingness will come over time and if it isn't there pray for it...If you are there listen to the Joe and Charlie tapes on 8 and 9. One of the most useful tips is to make four boxes of amends: now later maybe and never. As you make amends go through that list in order from now to never and your willingness will grow as you go through them
Are you working with a sponsor? That's important. 
*This is how I think I offended/harmed you. .*How can I amend these offenses/harms?.*Are there any other offenses/harms I caused you??..It's important to offer the other person a chance to talk and give their side and just listen. Also if they say don't worry about it etc and let you off the hook review with sponsor as he/she may direct you in another means of amend. 
Here's a great talk on steps 8 and 9.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oONtnBMTmww
