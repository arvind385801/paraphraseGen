My old resentments are bubbling up again. I thought I forgot it but I've been forced to spend time with some negative people I loathe thanks in special part to my wife and can't let it go. ..I need help. Can someone recommend?

Do you have a sponsor? What does he say? Have you worked the steps?
4th step out of the big book should help ... we  let go  of resentments when we are exposed to the truth that they aren't even real ... when u haven't done the work u have a better chance of holding ur pee for the rest of ur life than letting go of a resentment by choice 
Write the resentments down in 3 columns: who it is why you are resentful how it effects you. Add a 4th column which is your part. Read it to a sponsor. Go from there. 
Pray that the ppl you loathe receive happiness and prosperity 
Resentments are tough. They ruin the days that could have been fun. I can't be happy and resentful at the same time. A four column inventory reviewed with a sponsor is the best bet to clear it up. 
I took a sponsee through his 5th step yesterday. The day before he got demoted at work and in a threatening manner told his gf he was going to get  f'd up . Whether he was serious or not it was an example of how a resentment actually has the power to kill. Says so in our literature too. I was able to point this out &amp; he saw the correlation. Many a people picked up from spite anger etc. I must remember this myself. 
Praying for those people you have resentments towards. Realizing they are sick people. Understanding that when we let those resentments linger we are only hurting ourselves. Like drinking poison and waiting for the other person die.  Even in the case of justified resentments. Let it go and you release yourself from them. They hold no power over you.
