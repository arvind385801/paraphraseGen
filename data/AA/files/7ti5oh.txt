The title basically says it all. I do not relate to calling my higher power God and I struggle to work through and read the big book with the constant mentions of God. One person in the program even told me to think of God as an acronym for Good Orderly Direction and I like that idea but if there is a text out there preferably in print that has simply altered that word I would really love to find it. I did some searching online and came up with nothing. I'm sure some of you further along in recovery whose higher power is not God have gotten over the frequent mentions in the book but as a newcomer with two weeks sobriety I just want something I can relate to more. Does that make sense? I've had a bad experience with organized religion growing up and connotation of God puts me off even though I know I can choose my own concept of higher power. And yes I read the chapter on agnostics but darn it that word God just keeps tripping me up.

There is no alternate version of the big book yet people of all different faiths/gender/etc. have been able to use it to find sobriety for nearly 80 years. Just imagine how every woman ever to join AA has had to substitute "he/him" for "she/her" in the big book. Could you imagine if they were unable to interpret the book in the way that worked for them? There'd be no sober women in AA if they couldn't get past that. You can read/interpret anything you want in the big book to make it work for you or you can find the things you don't like to give yourself a reason to fail. It's not that big of a deal. 
I was very much like you and had this idea as well. I just kept going to meetings got a sponsor and went through the steps with them. This old idea of being closed off from the word God and it's sourness in my mouth faded away. It is amazing how much this little word had so much power over me and my recovery. When I did step three I have my higher power control and I stopped giving a fuck about little things like "God." It's just a short word that describes MY higher power to me that's it. 
I am afraid that there isn't a modified version of The Big Book at least not one that's sanctioned by AA.  ..The idea of editing or modifying the book has arisen several times in the past and has been rejected. Current scientific and psychoanalytical knowledge of the condition of addiction far exceeds what we knew when the book was written. Societal shifts in the roles of women makes "To Wives" seem at best quaint and at worst misogynistic.  ..The problem is not what to change **from** but what to change **to**. Recognizing the nature of the alcoholic mind AA has wisely foreseen that any attempt to edit the book would end up becoming confrontational divisive and would unlikely be of benefit to AA as a whole.  ..Personally I see the "God" word as a brand name for the best qualities of human nature...the spiritual principles. I don't envision "God" as a old guy on a throne in the sky smiting some and blessing others.  ..One person I met long ago said to him God is Love and whenever he saw the word "God" in the book he mentally replaced it with "Love".  ..All you really need to know about God at this point is that you ain't Him. This isn't your Universe to sculpt to your will and your whim. The other people here aren't here to serve you. Don't worry too much about it past that.  ..I came into this program an atheist and to some degree I still am although I have managed to find a place for a Higher Power in my recovery. When I began this process I would say in the morning *"I don't know if there's anyone listening but if there is please help me be free of the temptation to drink today and if there is any way I can help another person make it obvious because I'm an idiot and I don't take hints very well."*  ..Then at night I would say *"Okay I am back. I am grateful to have made it through another day sober thank you. Let's review the day and see where I might have been able to do a little better."*  ..This is what passes for "prayer" in my recovery. Whether it's going to "God" or a "Cosmic Consciousness" or nowhere at all isn't of much consequence to me. It helps me stay sober and that's what counts.
Recovery by Russell Brand is pretty close. It goes through all the steps in a more accessible format. 
There is the Universal Edition (not AA endorsed) which replaces the religious terminology for more neutral spiritual terminology. But from my experience after struggling with the big book at the beginning myself I am now completely comfortable with it after spending time (a lot of time) reading and working with it at meetings and with my sponsor. I have both versions but find all I need at this point is the big book.
What's more important being hung up on wording or staying sober?  The Big Book isn't going away.  It will be used and referenced in meetings until the end of time.  Will the use of the standard text keep you out of meetings?  I would hope not.  There are also agnostic meetings books and other readings for those of us with no religious belief.  I use books using mindfulness and Buddhism combined with the 12-Steps but I also lead and attend Big Book meetings and recognize the text as what continues to guide millions of people worldwide everyday.  ..This would be akin to wanting a book with a female characters name to be available with a male characters name in it's place.  Don't let God get in your way use mediation and what spiritual path you create for yourself help to keep you at peace.  Hang in there be grateful for sobriety at the start and end to every day and remember it is not a race with a finish line.  It is a path with unknown terrain ahead and a self interpreted map to follow.  AA will always have your back.  
good question and you're getting great answers in my opinion...On one hand i can see how you may have a negative connotation with the word god but it is a flexible word and you need to learn to be flexible too. God of course is used in the bible but there are many other terms for god in the bible which we do not use. The deities of the ancient greeks are called gods there are other examples too. I find it a small stretch to mentally change "god" with  "god as you understand him" perhaps it is so difficult because you are new but stick with it and it will get easier...On a side note.....I was just pondering for the people who ask questions like these and get overwhelmed with the same response from the fellowship the exact one they didn't really want that has to hurt a bit but when accepted it is a step toward honesty humility sobriety. 
Recovery by Russell Brand. His version of 12 Steps for everyone. I just listened to the audiobook. The book allows for you to insert whatever higher power works for you. I always thought Brand was a toolshed but this book is really good in my opinion especially the audio version because it's colored by his voice. It came out in 2017.
When I had to revisit step 3 because I couldn't continue with the HP I had chosen in the beginning my sponsor had me do an exercise where I went through We Agnostics circling every word I resisted. In a notebook I listed the words- and came up with a term to replace it with. My list included everything from God to the he/him pronouns. It was just an exercise but it's amazing the impact it had on me and my perceptions. I don't feel like I'm being asked to accept something I dont believe knowing that I've resolved the words themselves.
