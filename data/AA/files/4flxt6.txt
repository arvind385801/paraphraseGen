Any of you near the Boston (Newton area) or anywhere close by? Or would be willing to talk daily on the phone.. does not matter where you are...? I've been in the program for about a year. Haven't had a sponsor or worked the steps. I've relapsed on and off in that time. Went into an IOP program two months ago and since have relapsed. IDK if this is the place to look for it but fuck i need someone to talk to.

Even if you're across the world i'd love to talk to you
Go to a meeting. Get honest. Get a sponsor. Do the step work. Sobriety worked before man stepped for on the moon try it the way that's worked for 80+ years
I could use someone to talk to also. Message me. Find a local sponsor but get lots of supportive people.
hang in there.  as long as you know that you want to get sober you will.  Just have to let go and let the higher power take over.  You sound like you are deep in the beginning.  I know it seems like it is a never ending spiral but you will get there.  When you want to drink just think of how awful you feel and the regret it brings on.  That always helps me.
I would check out "the late show" meeting in Newton. I don't live in the area anymore so I honestly can't even remember the night or time but you can find it by using bostonaa.org
