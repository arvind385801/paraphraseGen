Just got the call a friend I had been in rehab with last year took his own life. ..The guy had just got visitation back with his son after like 2 years apart. He was starting to get things back but just couldn't keep going and couldn't beat his demons or his depression. ..He was a tough guy really struggled and fought back and he loved his kid but in the end lost his battle. So if you need another reason to not drink tonight think about not only where you might wake up but that you might not wake up at all. ..Love you YL may you rest in peace.
