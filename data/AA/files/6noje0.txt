Lately my mother has been going through the stages ever since I came out as an alcoholic. I admitted to a past drug addiction my problems with alcohol and much more. I needed to after 6 months of being sober and currently struggling. So here are my identifying stages. Feel free to add more if you have encountered certain reactions from loved ones. ..1. Stay One: Denial.."You don't have an addiction... I grew up around addicts. You aren't an addict"."I didn't think you drank too much. There's no way you have a problem. You just enjoy your drinks"..2. Stage Two: Confusion.." what no... those things didn't happen?" " I never knew that experience hurt you" "what are you talking about? I was there!" " how did I not see this??" "Why wasn't I paying attention?"..3. Stage Three: Anger/guilt ." is it because of me?" " I don't know why you are blaming this on me." " I don't have to change my life or support you through this. I'm fine.. your the one with the problem" "what? I'm not ignoring you. You just have to deal with it. Not me" " Your Father did this!! It's all his fault!! That son of a bitch" ..4. Stage Four: Misunderstandings.." well one day you can start drinking again" " I heard addiction is not a real problem... it's just a whole bunch of underlying problems that have to be corrected and your addiction will go away" " as long as this doesn't get in the way of your job. Everything will be fine"..5. Stage Five: Curiosity. ." So how long has this been going on?" "how much did you drink?" "how did you know you had a problem?" "what other events happen in your life that I don't know about?" "what did you talk about at AA today?" " Any juicy stories from the people in AA?" "Do I know anyone there?"
