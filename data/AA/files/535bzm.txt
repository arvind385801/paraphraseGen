This is hard. Keep coming. I did something very very similar and I'm almost at 5 months now. You can do it opening yourself up to the support of a higher power (be it God AA your family reddit whatever). ..Edit: one more thing. There is no problem drinking won't make worse at least for us. Including screaming kids (which I confront every day). That standard saying has helped me along. 
Keep coming back...Here is a secret about sobriety: sometimes it is one moment at a time especially when we are sitting on the pity-pot.  Everyone has gone through this so you are not unique...When you want to stay sober more than you want to wallow in self-pity go to a meeting or talk to somebody about how you are feeling.  You'll be OK...
Alcoholics relapse. Don't beat yourself up it's part of your journey. If you want different do different. If you want to be sober find sober people and keep them close..Hang in there and keep your head up. There is a great life ahead for you if you want it.
Keep reaching out brother. This thing isn't easy but it is simple. Go to meetings pick up the big book stick with the winners and don't pick up a drink for today.
Don't beat yourself up. Sober up and try again. But the next time you get a chance to sneak out to a bar try sneaking out to an AA meeting instead - the coffee is way cheaper and the company is way better.
Have you checked out the stopdrinking Reddit? It is a great resource...https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/.compact.
The choice is to go further down the tubes or start again. One choice is better than the other.
