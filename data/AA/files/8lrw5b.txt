"HAPPY JOYOUS AND FREE"..We are sure God wants us to be happy joyous and free. We cannot subscribe to the belief that this life is a vale of tears though it once was just that for many of us. But it is clear that we made our own misery. God didn't do it. Avoid then the deliberate manufacture of misery but if trouble comes cheerfully capitalize it as an opportunity to demonstrate His omnipotence...  ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS p. 133..For years I believed in a punishing God and blamed Him for my misery. I have learned that I must lay down the "weapons" of self in order to pick up the "tools" of the A.A. program. I do not struggle with the program because it is a gift and I have never struggled when receiving a gift. If I sometimes keep on struggling it is because I'm still hanging onto my old ideas and ". . . the results are nil."..
