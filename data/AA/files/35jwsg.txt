I'm kind of struggling the past few days. At work the other day a coworker confided in my she has a drinking problem. When she said it a lot of things clicked. Since being clean for a few years it hit me really hard this girl is becoming such a close friend of mine and it hurt my heart that I know what she's going through. I was thinking about bringing my copy to work and after we close just slipping it to her with a note or something. ..I think she would take it as intended I want to be a listening ear and support to her but I in no way want to push her into something because I know how that is. What do y'all think? Would it be a kind gesture as I mean it to be or could it send a negative message? We're the only two people most days and work together a lot so I don't want to make things weird/bad/negative in any way.
