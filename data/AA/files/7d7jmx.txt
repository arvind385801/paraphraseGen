One year! Today has been an emotional day. Surprised I stuck with something this long. Regretful of the past. Optimistic of the future. Terrified of relapse. Humbled by the support of family friends and strangers. Excited to help others. Worried I'm not doing enough to stay sober. But when I really think about it I'm mostly just grateful to have a second chance to be a human being and to be kind to people. ..One day at a time.

One hour is a gift one day day is a miracle one year is unfathomable. Be proud of yourself. People who don't even know you already are
Happy Birthday and congratulations on your year!  
Ask anyone with a drink problem to stay sober for one year see how hard it is.  Well done.   Keep doing the right things you don't need to worry about relapse.
