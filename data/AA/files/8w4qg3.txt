5 months is approaching for me. I relapsed just a few days after my 4 month coin in February. I've since found and accepted a higher power and am more than ready for a solid 4th step (first time). I have Back to Basics which is helpful but could really use some guidance on how to go about this step. I do not cut corners and I do not want the easier softer way. I've established progress that I'm extremely proud of. Any input suggestions and more is welcomed and appreciated.

My friend this forum is a great place for many things. I my opinion you really need the hand of a sponsor face to face  to walk through this. Peace
I agree with above comment I've done the steps a few different ways including back to basics but there's nothing like experiencing it one on one with a sponsor. Be thorough and honest as it says. 
Joe and Charlie big book experience. Ask any AA member with over 10 years sober about them. They just help explain the big book and take the steps exactly as they are supposed to be done. Here's a link to the audio.   .  ..https://www.silkworth.net/pages/freestuff.php.  .  .Dm me your email address if you want the paperwork they talk about.
There are clear cut directions in the big book find a sponsor to walk you through the process.
