You need to stop letting yourself be jerked around by others. Stay away from women. Don't let strangers into your home. ..You will be welcomed at meetings. What are you afraid of? Do you think you're the first person who has problems and made mistakes? Go back!
Doing the stuff that you don't in the least want to do can make the difference in using the rope or living well. Not doing the stuff almost invariably has a different and less pleasant ending...This situation is part of why it's a poor idea to take things from new people. Hopefully you'll hang with the less needy and more principled crowd this time. 
Two tips:..* "You can't carry other Alcoholics" this is slogan I heard from some other members.  The more common problem is members becoming a free Uber for Alcoholics who aren't serious...* Ask around for which meetings to go to these types avoid the well run meetings because they start to get asked to do service..
Your experience is a great example of why relationships are dangerous territory in early sobriety.  You may have helped a lot of people with your post.  I hope you make it back into AA so you can help some more.
