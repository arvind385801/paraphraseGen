We can exchange experiences perspectives circumstances etc...I can tell you my story how I did it and you can tell me your situation and what's going on...I would love to be a source of motivation and inspiration to anyone who is really struggling as I struggled the same just until two years ago... For some odd reason I love connecting with people who struggle with alcoholism and depression I guess because that's what I've known for most of my life. But it doesn't have to be like that always - I am living proof. Heavy drinking from age 18 to 25 set me back tremendously but I'm slowly starting to get my shit together and everyday is another step towards self-actualisation. I'm 27 now and life has never been better for me honestly and quitting was a huge part of this transformation but not the decisive part! It's all about the mentality and attitude you have. Whether you are a full-blown alcoholic recovering alcoholic or also one of those who beat the condition I would like to hear your story and build with you. I'm not afraid to expose my weaknesses and I hope so you aren't too - after all we don't know each other so talking with a random person should come easier in a sense.....PM me if interested
