I relapsed 5 days ago. I blew up my relationship. Shattered trust with every loved one I have. It's because I quit going to meetings and those character flaws I had been working on came back with a vengeance because I quit working on them. Don't be like me. Don't go back out it doesn't get better it gets worse. And I know it'll get better now that I'm in the meeting rooms again and have a sponsor again. I'm just struggling with the guilt and self loathing of all the lies I told leading to this relapse. Here's to one day at a time. Hoping I can get back to being someone I can love and respect as well as others. Thanks for your time and any advice is appreciated and welcomed.

Aww man I feel you.  And I mean that in the *least* superficial way possible.  I really do understand.  It's a shitty place to be because you know what the right choices are and you made the wrong ones. ..But stay up buddy.  There are many more sober happy years to live.  Just take it one. Day. At. A. Time.....I've relapsed more times than I can count but I'm doing well now and that's all I can ask for.  Give yourself the same opportunity; you deserve it. 
OK
No advice.  I am sorry you are struggling and hope you find your footing and foundation soon!    
I hope today is going better for you ::internet hug::
