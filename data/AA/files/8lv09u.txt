I'm having trouble with cravings today. I'm by no means clean of alcohol. I was doing well until I went to a music festival and decided to almost drink myself to death and if my girlfriend hadn't been there to turn me over I might not be here after that day I've been struggling every day the cravings in the morning just get worse as the night goes on and if I continue to drink I'll lose everything. It just so happens when I get even a little buzzed this sets off a chain reaction that starts making me loath and then anger follows along with projecting that anger on people close to me. ..Anyway you've all probably heard all this a million times. Just thought I should try to talk a little because right now I have nobody to confide in.

I'd check out AA man. I never thought in a million years that I would be into it... I thought I was far too cool and smart for that. Turns out that's the second biggest lie I ever told myself; the first being that I would one day drink like a normal person. .   I went to AA did the 12 steps as written in the book created a fellowship with other sober members of AA and it has by far become the best and most important thing I've ever done in my life. .   Seriously man.. give it a shot. What do you have to lose?

\*I was doing well until I went to a music festival and decided to almost drink myself to death\*..There was a reason that happened. You weren't doing well.
