I have days when I don't know how **I** feel; I'm simply not qualified to tell you how you should feel...It seems to me your best option is to get to a meeting and try and figure out how you feel and then go from there.
I can't let anything anyone else does make me drink...I have to keep myself clean because I can't do anything if I'm in the disease.
There is nothing so bad that drinking won't make it worse. ..Another's behavior is not going to snag me into the web of addiction. Going to meetings working the steps and having a therapist gave me tools to deal with my emotions. I learned to make healthier choices. ..I'm sorry about your dad. Alcoholics lie. Didn't you?
