"When we retire at night we constructively review our day. Were we resentful selfish dishonest or afraid? Do we owe an apology? Have we kept something to ourselves which should be discussed with another person at once? Were we kind and loving toward all? What could we have done better? Were we thinking of ourselves most of the time? Or were we thinking of what we could do for others of what we could pack into the stream of life? But we must be careful not to drift into worry remorse or morbid re ection for that would diminish our usefulness to others. After making our review we ask God's forgiveness and inquire what corrective measures should be taken...On awakening let us think about the twenty-four hours ahead. We consider our plans for the day. Before we begin we ask God to direct our thinking especially asking that it be divorced from self-pity dishonest or self-seeking motives. Under these conditions we can employ our mental faculties with assurance for after all God gave us brains to use. Our thought-life will be placed on a much higher plane when our thinking is cleared of wrong motives...In thinking about our day we may face indecision. We may not be able to determine which course to take. Here we ask God for inspiration an intuitive thought or a decision. We relax and take it easy. We don't struggle. We are often surprised how the right answers come after we have tried this for a while...87..What used to be the hunch or the occasional inspiration gradually becomes a working part of the mind. Being still inexperienced and having just made conscious contact with God it is not probable that we are going to be inspired at all times. We might pay for this presumption in all sorts of absurd actions and ideas. Nevertheless we  nd that our thinking will as time passes be more and more on the plane of inspiration. We come to rely upon it...We usually conclude the period of meditation with a prayer that we be shown all through the day what our next step is to be that we be given whatever we need to take care of such problems. We ask especially for freedom from self-will and are careful to make no request for ourselves only. We may ask for ourselves however if others will be helped. We are careful never to pray for our own sel sh ends. Many of us have wasted a lot of time doing that and it doesn't work. You can easily see why...If circumstances warrant we ask our wives or friends to join us in morning meditation. If we belong to a religious denomination which requires a de nite morning devotion we attend to that also. If not members of religious bodies we sometimes select and memorize a few set prayers which emphasize the principles we have been discussing. There are many helpful books also. Suggestions about these may be obtained from one's priest minister or rabbi. Be quick to see where religious people are right. Make use of what they offer...As we go through the day we pause when agitated or doubtful and ask for the right thought or action. We constantly remind ourselves we are no longer..88..running the show humbly saying to ourselves many times each day  Thy will be done.'' We are then in much less danger of excitement fear anger worry self-pity or foolish decisions. We become much more ef cient. We do not tire so easily for we are not burning up energy foolishly as we did when we were trying to arrange life to suit ourselves..It works it really does."..Step eleven Alcoholics Anonymous..... I read this passage everyday from day one of sobriety and practiced these principles. Even though you may not be at step eleven you can still practice these principles to get through the 24 hrs ahead..... Enjoy the day
