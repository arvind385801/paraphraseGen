The 11th tradition suggests that we not promote the program as it could do it harm. We all have heard the tale in the rooms of if someone who was promoting the program happened to relapsed it would put the program into a bad light...But what about ourselves? The 11th tradition from a personal aspect suggests us not promoting ourselves by telling people we are in the program. By following this suggestion we focus on ourselves prevent putting pressure ourselves and give ourselves a break...Think of it this way... We have all have joined or have known someone who has joined a gym. In the beginning we are all gong-ho and go everyday and tell everyone we know that we are going to the gym to look better and feel better. Most people give us praise while a few laugh at us wanting us to fail. Problem is that we might only start to focus on the people laughing at us and begins build a resentment towards them. Slowly we quit going to the gym because now going to the gym becomes about them and showing them up and not about ourselves...Staying focused on ourselves and wanting to improve our own lives is what will keep us wanting to work the program.

Well keep in mind the tradition refers quite specifically to "at the level of press radio and film".  It doesn't say or to me even imply "at the level of one person talking to another person"...Personally I've no problem with letting people know I'm in AA.  Over the years there have been a couple of times where it became beneficial to me (and others) that this reality is known outside of my own head...Regarding those who laugh: not my problem.  I own my reaction to them: not the other way 'round eh?  For the one who needs to know or the one who asks honest questions with an intent to learn I'll gladly put up with the one who laughs or the one who predicts failure ... and the 98 others who say "good for you" :)
Yes on the level of press radio and films. Simply put I can tell my family friends strangers that I'm sober but I can't break another memebers anonymity. And I can give my last name to the members or some members of my homegroup we shouldn't be anonymous to eachother because what if I relapse and they need to find me in the hospital.
