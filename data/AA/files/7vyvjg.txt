18 months ago I walked into the rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous...This was one day after I got caught drinking in the basement again tipping the can back out of the corner of my eye seeing my wife coming down the steps caught dead to rights...I walked in to a small meeting.  I told myself it was better than walking into a huge room of strangers...I sat in the chairs for a few months just sitting there not talking much just being there...Something told me I needed to get a sponsor.  I walked up to someone with some time and asked about the whole sponsor thing.  She pointed me in the right direction and I found a sponsor...I started doing the steps with no preconceptions to what God was or how much work the steps would take or if this would work.  I didn't have any expectations set...I went through the steps with my sponsor and let go of all my resentments...I had a spiritual experience and was awakened to this life I had been passing through for so long...18 months ago I walked into the rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous only to be awakened and saved.  I owe everything to the rooms of AA...Science says if one person can be going through what you're going through and still be happy then it's possible.  Recovery is possible.  Anything is possible for this alcoholic and it can be for you too...Participate in your recovery you'll have a life beyond your wildest dreams..
