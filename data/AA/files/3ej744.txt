so i have started seeing a girl who is in AA. she apparently had a big problem (day drinking every day driving and showing up to work drunk) but a drunk driving accident put her in the program and she has been sober for a little while (8 months then a relapse but 4 months since). i had a bit of a problem with alcohol after my divorce but realized that wasn't who i was and forced myself to learn self discipline. it was an incredibly hard struggle but i can drink responsibly while having fun and have been distancing myself from my friends that were problem drinkers. my main problem was how much of my life revolves around alcohol. i work at a bar that is known for their high end beer selection my brother manages a brewery close friends own a beer distributor other friends at a winery. i have noticed since i started talking to this girl that every social event i go to alcohol is at least abundant if not the focal point. i am worried that hanging out with me could lead her down the path to relapse. she says she is fine with it and doesn't mind being around it or talking about it. i try not to dwell on alcohol and be sensitive and supportive but it's in my nature to be a worrier. i care about this girl and if she says she can't be around me for her own good i would understand but i don't think either of us want that. anyone who has been in the program have any advice for me?

Her sobriety is her responsibility not yours. If she works the steps and makes staying sober her priority then she should be able to attend such things without issue. This requires constant work with a sponsor and helping other alcoholics achieve sobriety. ..What i would suggest for you is to communicate these concerns with her. If she is telling you that she is fine with it then you should be too. If she is scared to tell you it bothers her bc she may lose you then the relationship is probably doomed due to an inability to be honest in fear of consequences. Working with the sponsor is how to be honest in the face of fear and if this principle is not taken seriously then there isn't much hope of success in sobriety or hope for any other successful relationships in sobriety. ..How can you help? Let her know that if she is apprehensive about attending an event that it's ok to say so. Let her know that if she begins to feel uncomfortable then it's ok to leave. Have a plan in place so when she does mention discomfort you can act without trying to figure it all out in the chaos of the moment. Ask what if any places or situations have made her uncomfortable so far and support her when/if they come up again. Meetings are priority over any plans if i get restless irritable or discontent so support her in this as well. ..Communicate with her and let her know it's ok to communicate with you. Compromise where necessary but know that if she doesn't stay sober (if she's like me) then there's no chance of having a healthy relationship.
