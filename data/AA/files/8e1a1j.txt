I've been struggling on and off over the years with drinking and quitting for months at a time - longest was a year and a half. I was attending AA at that time although I never really participated fully. Today I had enough of being scared- I went into a meeting today and raised my hand and asked for the sponsors to raise their hand. I found a sponsor today and I'm ready to work the steps but I am very nervous about it.

Well done that's a start. Take his suggestions being willing call another Alcoholic.  Easy does it . And course Keep coming back. 
Don't set yourself up for failure...Just try to do it one day at a time...As they say in Texas "I had one foot in yesterday and one foot in tomorrow and I was pissing all over today.'
