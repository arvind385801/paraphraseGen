This is my first time in recovery. I have five years and some change and I'm 27. My husband is now 39 and he had a few goes at sobriety but I never knew the side of him that drank or used. His sober date was 8/6/2010. When we got married of course I thought about my vows in sickness and in health good and bad all of that but I honestly thought deep down it would always be sober and sober. I trusted him 100% come to find out first weekend in June that he's been relapsed on pills....found out later it's been for two years almost our whole marriage. ..It's been a really rough two months since finding out. He went to detox for a week slipped and has been using until about two weeks ago he went to treatment and I'm really proud of him for making that decision. ..The crazy part is dealing with my disease. I know I have no power. I know this. I know I didn't cause it and I can't fix it. But it's like all of that doesn't make sense anymore when it's the person I love most. And yeah I know it makes the family sick too...I have a lot of guilt and fear. I can't believe I was so blind to it but I guess my higher power knew I wasn't ready to see it. I know I should get myself to Al Anon. ..I was grateful to be an alcoholic bc there's a solution. But now I'm so bitter at the disease again. Cuz I know that my husband might not get this and I have to accept that he could die. How can I be grateful

&gt; I know I should get myself to Al Anon...You have the answer already. 
How can you be grateful? you still have your sobriety your still alive and breathing and this could reinforce to you that this disease sucks and is always in us and never goes away.  just maybe it will make you cherish your sobriety more.  keep working a program.  best wishes
