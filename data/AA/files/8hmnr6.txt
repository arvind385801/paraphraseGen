RESPECT FOR OTHERS..Such parts of our story we tell to someone who will understand yet be unaffected. The rule is we must be hard on ourself but always considerate of others...  ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS p. 74..Respect for others is the lesson that I take out of this passage. I must go to any lengths to free myself if I wish to find that peace of mind that I have sought for so long. However none of this must be done at another's expense. Selfishness has no place in the A.A. way of life...When I take the Fifth Step it's wiser to choose a person with whom I share common aims because if that person does not understand me my spiritual progress may be delayed and I could be in danger of a relapse. So I ask for divine guidance before choosing the man or woman whom I take into my confidence...
