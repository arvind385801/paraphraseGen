My Wednesday 10am is a Beginners there are a lot of Old Timers so they keep it to Beginners (there is a rehab up the block so we get a bunch of younger folks from there).A gentleman shared that he was a chronic relapser (I am too) he said because of the Steps when he falls down he get back up...It was an excellent point and it really hit me- I need to keep going to meetings because that is going to help me get back up and hopefully STAY UP.

I got a sponsor and worked the steps. 
You never ever know what you're gonna hear at a meeting that will change the way you see things and you never  know when you're gonna say something that changes the way someone thinks. 
Thank you for sharing..
An old timer said to me that anyone who relapses never *truly* worked the steps. Which doesn't mean they will never get it it just means they need to do just that truly work them..So just make sure your not doing the same thing over and over.
