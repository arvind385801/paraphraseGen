I've always looked at people who were classified as an "alcoholic" were people who would wake up in the morning and have a drink as their morning ritual and would drink through out the day that was just what I was taught at least my mom has a drink maybe once every two weeks and has two sips if that my dad hardly drank either because he had too much going on like owning 4 businesses and still trying to find time to enjoy the smaller things in life I worked around alcohol for a long time being a bartender and would only drink after work a few times but nothing drastic that would make me concerned for my own health and then I moved to the states made some friends who I wouldn't say had the greatest influence on me I began drinking heavily but only ever on the weekend but getting drunk to the point of waking up with three hours of sleep (if that) and not remembering a dam thing I did the night before and slowly struggling to make it through the day before the clock struck evening and then we would be at the bars again hopping from one to another getting any guy to buy us a drink and randomly vanishing from the scene before they realized we were only using them for one thing free Booz. The things I did still surprise me to this day that nothing bad ever happened to me (thank goodness for that) getting into cars with people I didn't know falling over and waking up with big bruises through out my body and hooking up with multiple guys in less then 6 hours sleeping any where I found fit through my intoxicated eyes I viewed this behavior as normality because what person in their twenties doesn't like to party and drink? Some mornings I would wake up and say to myself that this was the last of it I hated the feeling of being drained having no energy to do anything other then sit in a bed and watch movies trying to sleep trying to ease my hangover but nothing would fix it except of course the obvious term "hair of the dog"  so I did and by having one drink it led to more and for the person I am I have no limit I drink even though I'm drunk (because that was the purpose) to feel ontop of the world even if it was for a few hours smoking with it only gave you a higher rush and so the weekends persisted like this and soon it was routine. My boyfriend and I like to drink to excess I would say for any normal person and I think it's because we both like to be this confident person and chat with every body and be the crowd pleaser. It's only a few nights ago that I really got a fright I've been having difficulty sleeping I wake up randomly only after a few hours of sleep and my body automatically goes to awake mode and then I'm stuck thinking about ways I could fall asleep the other night I took a swig of whiskey that foul taste burned through my throat as it made its way down to my stomach and poor liver I got what I aimed for I fell asleep but the next day felt like a zombie the same thing occurred this morning so I thought downing a drink filled with a double shot of vodka to my surprise there was no buzz and even more awareness I think writing this is making me realize that there is something not right and I need to fix what I have Broken my plan is to not have a drink for 30 days (that's the aim) to see if I am capable  im sure all of you reading this will think that 30 day fix is definitely not the answer but I feel making a short term goal will lead me to a big term one and it will help me with my binge drinking problem. Here's to the first day of being sober and I will write every day to help you guys follow my progress I hope to overcome this and I feel this is the first step in doing so. Each day I will tell you the horror stories of what I did and how I'm overcoming it.

Get to a meeting talk to someone in person.  It's amazing how much others can help. 
Your bottom is wherever you stop digging...Kudos to realizing you have a problem with alcohol and wanting to stop drinking! It's the hardest and best thing I ever did in my life...My only SUGGESTION (because advice never helped me) is that you don't focus so much on the time as much as you focus on connecting with other people who also don't drink to foster camaraderie and community...It's easier to stay sober with others rather than alone...AA has been my go to community because there are meetings all over the world at all hours of the day filled with people from all backgrounds of all ages and trust me- all experiences. Check one out in your city/town: http://aa-intergroup.org..You're not obligated to say or do ANYTHING you can come and listen and go at your leisure...I think we're a pretty neat bunch!..Keep trudging and happy day 1.
Check out also /r/stopdrinking. 
It's one day at a time.
