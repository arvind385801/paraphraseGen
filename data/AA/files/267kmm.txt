I don't know where to begin.  I am a functional closet alcoholic.  I have been for the past 10 years...Due to the nature of my work and the small community that I live in I cannot join an in-person AA group.  It would be too risky and might jeopardize my career and reputation...So I thought I would try this as a means to vent and perhaps get some support...On a light night of drinking I will consume a half of a fifth of vodka.  On a heavy night I will consume the entire fifth...I am divorced and alone.  My divorce was not caused by my alcoholism; however my alcoholism has prevented me from having a meaningful relationship now that I am single...Each night I drink to the point that I have no memory of the night before when I wake up the next morning...When I try to take a night off and not drink I cannot sleep and sweat like I have run a marathon...Grief is the cause of my alcoholism.  ..I wish I knew how to flip a switch in me to make me stop drinking...I'm not sure why I am even typing any of this...I don't think I have ever been as emotionally and physically exhausted as I am right now...Help...
