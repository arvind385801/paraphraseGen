As in life the people we associate with influence us. Be around people you want to become that possess the qualities you want for yourself...This goes double for people in the program... Hang around with people who relapse and soon you will relapse...The hardest lesson to learn is to let go of the people with bad influences in our lives.

Stick with the winners?  That's I hear in the rooms.  Who helps the losers the chronic relapsers? 
I hung out with Chronic relapses and now they are sober helping others res a big difference between hanging out with some who is struggling to stay sober and someone who doesn't even want to get sober. 
Ah we are so lucky to be in your presence. You won't relapse because you hang around the winners. I'm guessing you must be a first time winner. Because I'd hate to think someone who has went back out is lecturing us about who we hang out with. Especially using a throw away...I don't know I feel I'm in good company if I'm in a meeting. I feel I can learn from the person who has gone back out and the person who hasn't. I don't know if I'll stay sober the rest of my life so I sure as fuck won't judge someone else for drinking. That's what we did. We don't have to do that anymore if we don't want to.
Well that's sure a shit post.... I hang with people who relapse all the time. That's what AA is for Gods sakes. .   You should get to work if this is really how you feel. If everyone did this there would be no fellowship. .   I hope no one listens to your garbage.. and it's just that. Garbage.
