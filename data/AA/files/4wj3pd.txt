First of all I go to doctor for my depression this a medical condition. And sometimes depression discourages me from working the steps and speaking and doing AA because I feel like I won't feel better anyway so what's the point. ..But I'm going to continue living the steps and although I'm early in recovery I had 4 years and relapsed. I'm still gonna try to do AA and work with my doctor sometimes I just get discouraged

It took me several months for the depression caused by many years of alcoholic drinking to clear.  Hang in there and give time time.
Kudos for having a sponsor and working on the steps. That was at times depressing because it forced me to honestly face myself. Depression is difficult; I suffer from it too. Hopefully you'll continue working with your doctor until you find some balance. Take life one day at a time. Thanks for posting. 
Tae kwon do changed a lot of things contributing to my depression and drinking. It (or any martial arts) gave me small little goals like getting a kick right and the progress game me a real sense of pride...Find something where you can visibly see your progress along with working the steps and hopefully it will help you as it helped me.
