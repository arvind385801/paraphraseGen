This is exactly the right way to look at a relapse not only if it is you but also a friend. Some people feel alienated after relapsing and have trouble making it back due to fear of the perceived stigma against relapsers. Although I feel most groups are good about this there is no reason to treat a person like they are "dirty" if you know they've relapsed and came back in. On any given day we are one prayer or one bad decision away from going back out. We learn from our mistakes and move forward.
