In recovery for 3 years. 126 days back after very short relapses that ended me in a psychotic state. So I came back quick. Havent had a drink in a while but my main thing was pot...I take medication for my mental illness and last weekend culminated a week long manic state. Couldnt recognize myself in the mirror. My meds have been tweaked. Doing better today. ..Meetings are great. They are a safe haven for me. I enjoy them a lot and have made tons of friends. 3000 meetings a week in this county...Good luck and stay strong ya'll.

Thanks for your post and kudos for three years. I'm glad you're feeling better; sounds like you had a scary time. Take care of yourself!
I hope you keep coming. Never give up.
Welcome back!     ..I am getting ready to take a trip and have already lined up a few I want to hit.
