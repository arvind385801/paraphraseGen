So I was court mandated to go to AA. First year and a half was pretty bad considering I couldn't and didn't want to stay sober. I spent that first year and a half in and out of jail for relapsing. Finally I went on to a long term treatment facility in Arizona. This treatment center was in the middle of the goddamn desert. At first I was psyched to have a brand new start. I was excited to make new friends and begin a new life. .Well that gung-ho attitude soon disappeared. The rehab itself was abusive to the extreme if you didn't comply with their rules. Now I'm all for obeying rules and regulations. However I had a terrible experience at this rehab. I quite literally got into trouble nearly every single day while I was there. And a lot of the time it was over really trivial shit. Now I'm not a bitch to people unless they give me a reason to be. And if you put 24 newly sober girls under one roof chances are it won't necessarily be a pleasant experience. But these girls were downright rude and obnoxious. And if I were to stand up for myself and tell these idiots to fuck off I'D be the one getting in trouble. .Now I am in no way trying to play the victim here. But I fucking hated Arizona with every fiber of my being. And I especially loathed that fucking rehab and everyone in it. As soon as I could leave I did. I moved back home and started attending AA again. .Fast forward to me being dry for 4&1/2 years and I'm contemplating suicide and literally have no desire to work the program. I'm an atheist. I don't believe in god and I never will. And the more people try to shove their AA nonsense down my throat the closer I am to telling them to go shove a truck up their ass. Yes I know I sound extremely angry. And ya know what? I am. I gave myself to AA for nearly 6 years and honestly it didn't do anything but make things worse for me. .I know that AA is NOT a hot bed of mental health. But the severity of how fucked up people are to others blows my mind. I'm not perfect. Not anywhere close. And I've been known to be a total bitch to those who don't deserve it. I'm not proud of it. But I went back to AA to get sober and happy not angry and bitter and thinking suicide would be the best solution than anything else. .I don't find AA to be helpful. I don't trust anyone in that god forsaken program. Granted I had a horrible upbringing and that certainly didn't help matters. I've also tried SMART recovery and other ways to stay sober. I'm going to therapy twice a week. I think I'm gonna try creative recovery. I need help.

My co addiction to anger made my early recovery a game of chutes and ladders.  ..AA didn't work for me until I was ready to change.  Not accepting Jesus am still agnostic but letting go of being right all the time helped a lot...You may be able do it without AA I know some who have but there are some tools you might want to take with you...Good luck
I was absolutely convinced that the higher power concept wouldn't work for me. I got desperate enough to try something else. I learned about Thomas Jefferson Albert Einstein and Re e Descarte who originally rejected the idea of a higher being only to be driven back after years of scientific discovery. I also learned how there's scientific proof that meditation can change the way a person's brain works. For me that have me enough of a motivation to try prayer and meditation. I absolutely do not pray to any religious church god. I know that geniuses from history and current science show that life had more meaning when it has a spiritual component.  Give the steps another try with a different take on your higher power it might just work. ...Or don't feel free to keep doing what you are doing you get to decide how your recovery goes. 
i'm sorry you're having such a struggle. It's good you are seeing a therapist. It sounds like you had trauma in your childhood and AA doesn't do a good job of addressing those issues. ...**Working these steps saved my life**:.____________________________________________________________________...Step 1: I'm in a mess and over my head...Step 2: Maybe I don't have all the answers . so I'll ask for help...Step 3: Decide to pay attention to advice given. ..Step 4: Take an honest look at how I've been living my life...Step 5: Tell someone else about my unhealthy lifestyle and harm to others. ..Step 6: Decide to live a healthier kinder life...Step 7: Make specific changes toward that goal.. .Step 8: List everyone I have hurt...Step 9: Have the courage to tell them I'm sorry &amp; make amends except if doing so would cause harm. ..Step 10: Keep an eye on myself alert to old thinking and behaviors. ..Step 11: Be aware of the beauty in the world and people. ..Step 12: Pass on to others the kindness extended to me. .
I forgot to mention that after that 4&amp;1/2 year stint I decided to leave AA and start doing drugs and alcohol again. It didn't get better. Alcohol and drugs made me their bitch and my health drastically deteriorated because of it. I ended up in the hospital with asphyxiated pneumonia and severe sepsis of the kidneys. I then tried to get sober through AA again but relapsed because quitting everything was too much for me. I'm a smoker hence the pneumonia. I've started smoking again but I don't do it that much. It's really for sanity reasons and emergencies. I'm two months sober today and while I'm proud of that I just wish I could find like-minded people to do things with. Fun things. I just want to be myself and have a good life. 
Thanks man. I've been around AA for 8 years now. Been to plenty of meetings. Some I love and some I refuse to go to anymore. I am desperate; you're right about that. I'm not saying fuck it all. I'm just tired of feeling like this. I know that maybe my mistake was never really working a program. I never got through all the steps in real life outside of rehab. Basically because I don't believe in a "higher power" and also because I found the steps to be something I have no desire to do. But yeah I'll check your comments out on the subject. Merry Christmas! Or happy holidays. :)
Hiya. *(damn. sorry. wrote another book)*..I have been lucky enough to go to a lot of meetings around universities. In those rooms and then even in the rural backwaters I heard this phrase many times "Some of us are too smart for AA and it kills us." ..I was almost exactly in the same position as you are in and I was killing myself. I could not stop killing myself. I tried all the different types of recovery and I could not stop killing myself. I could not stop using and when I used I always went way too far. ..Then one day I did what you did and I was honest to another person. I told them pretty much the same thing...One of the things I was able to hear was how totally unbelievably dangerous our problem is. **We cannot think out of it.** I promise you that if you can stay sober for over a year or two you will be able to look back and see how our disease/addiction warps reason. It warps our minds. There is nothing else on the earth that can make a person think that something good is bad or wrong.  ..For some reason that kinda stuck in my head. They experienced the exact same thing I was living through. I could not stop but I would not try anything without dissecting it until it was useless...About this time I was running out of options. I had no insurance and was running out of resources. So I had to try AA. All of the mumbo jumbo was blocking me; I was letting it block me. Then like others have typed and like you did I shared about it. I had many people tell me how they used the program without a 'traditional' higher power. There were atheists and non-believers who told me about how they were able to break chains of addition by placing their perspective or their understanding or their philosophy in a proper place. What I got out of that is that again I had to realize that my disease was warping my reason. ..I had to get teachable like I was when I was student and as I was as a scholar of life. Was I smarter than the philosophers or the great scientists? No. Was I so smart that the scientific method no longer applied to my life? No. Was I so ruined and stupid that I could not start learn how to apply science and reason to my life? No but I had to be careful. I saw over and over how smart people were killing themselves with this disease. ..And that's how I started to use AA. Just like scientists and scholars I started following the methods used by others to create hypotheses. If I don't drink and if I do certain things do I get similar results: like those guys and girls did in AA for over 70 years? To cut to the chase yes. ..If I stay teachable and if I continue to do what a majority of walking experiments people in programs did I get to stay alive and more importantly I get to start having unwarped reason again. That is one of my biggest rewards of being sober and clean. I am not a crazy fuck anymore...Still all the religious things made me feel uncomfortable. I felt like I was persecuted. I felt that I could never fit in. Luckily this old person told me to go to meetings in the poor part of town. Also go to LGBT meetings. Why? He said those people deal with 'being different' or 'being excluded' or 'being a minority' type issues every single moment of their lives and they don't let that get in the way of their sobriety. I went to a couple of those meetings and I knew I had to no real reason to feel persecuted or different...Yet not everyone is like us. There are billions of people in the world that still believe in religion or whatever. The great thing about our rooms is that it really isn't forced up our arses. My grand sponsor has over 30 years and he is an proclaimed atheist. Our home group is in the suburbs of Houston where there are more churches than Starbucks and nobody really cares what he believes or doesn't believe. They don't burn him at the stake or whatever. No one really cares because after a while the specifics of it just don't come up.  ..I know at the beginning it really feels like everyone is trying to get you to believe but I promise you. No one really cares. Sure there are a couple of churchy McChurches that have to convert everyone they see but those are the oddities. They are not the normal environment. I have been in and out of our rooms for way over 15 years now and no one cares what you believe. ..What everyone does care about is trying to do something good for themselves. What everyone does care about is trying to stay teachable and to not let our disease take over our lives and our brains again. What everyone does care about is trying to help others because that's what saved their lives. Someone took the time to try to help them...People can't stand AA because there are no professionals. Think about it for a minute. You got EVERY single type of person in the world in those rooms. Some dropped out of high school. Some have multiple degrees. Some believe in the tooth fairy. But what is weird is that they all are trying to do what a large group of people did before them and they are all mostly having success at not drinking and using for another day. What is weird is that for some it works. With all the flaws and all the stupid shit humans do a large appreciable percentage of people that do this can stop drinking and using and get their minds back enough to create a good enough life for themselves..
Hey pm me and I'll give u my number. If I post it here idk if they will delete it but if u need to talk im in the program and I'm only 24. You don't have to believe in God. I don't know what God is I just believe in whatever is getting us in touch right now. I mention I'm 24 bc I never wanted to do this shit my experience though is I started working the steps bc I TOO HATED LIFE SOBER until I started working the steps and doing the RECOVERY. There is a big difference. I'll be up if you want to talk to somebody. If not I wish we the best. Don't know you but still love you. 
I do AA without god. Spirituality and theism are two completely different things. You just have to have a willingness to get better and admit that there are things bigger in this world that you have no control over. My higher power is chaos because I know I have no control over most things in life. ..
Yes fucking hell yes...The people in recovery are some of the most fucked up assholes I've ever experienced in my life....This needs to be known. Recovery is filled with people that are fucking retarded. Like me.....The whole G0d thing was just not even....I couldn't I had tried that shit fuck that mess.....I got lucky though because I took all that feel believe love yourself BULLSHIT and dumped it like the diarrhea that haunted my asshole for the first year and a half fucking shitheads....I knew that none of those fucktards had the answer any more than I had the answer and and this is the lucky part I found someone who seemed to have an answer but and this is a big but was not nearly as full of shit as everyone else seemed to be......I showed up in Alcoholics Anonymous and knew that I didn't want what I had because that sucked but I didn't want what the majority of fucked up losers that populated the rooms and polluted my ears with their failure had either....I had to seek. Seek I did. ...Seek and find...Good fucking luck. 
I identify with your anger towards the system our little condition and the people and program of AA. You're a lot tougher than I was to put 4 1/2 years together before drinking again. During 6 years the most I could bear was 4 months. Arrests and treatment programs continually returned me to AA. I was not a nice newcomer and regret some of my actions now...I finally hung out with a former bad drunk and thief who was doing all the AA stuff and sending out a check each month to his former victims. It wasn't all windy bs with him. He was getting good results and gave me his time and help conditionally-he cared as much and no more than I cared about my staying sober...Results had become more important to me than the methods to achieve them at that point so with great reluctance and a bad attitude I did what he did. At one meeting we attended each week I was not called on for 3 years due to my nasty attitude and visage. People would start to hug me and freeze in before they made physical contact. I didn't have to say a thing...Really doing AA changed me enough to stay sober longterm and keep the rebel down enough to get along well and have a great life. I've not met a nastier newcomer than I was during these last 35 years. Maybe that's you and maybe it's not. Point is our similar attitude is no bar against getting good results from the efforts we make and it has a great personal cost if you allow it to prevent you from getting well..
Here is how everyone who ever stays sober does it no matter what program or system they use and that is by not drinking.  No one in AA makes you believe or do anything - if we could we'd make you stay sober but we don't have that kind of power.  The common denominator in all these relapses is YOU.  And I don't say this to say you're a shitty or bad person.  You're not.  You're sick like we all were.  Therapy is an excellent choice - really just about every person could benefit from good therapy at some point.  Here's a main thing about AA even if you don't get into the steps is that it's a place where people are working on creating a sober way of life and try hard to help each other and that helps for many a troubled person.  One way or the other I hope you find a support network that is effective for you so you have people who understand your struggles to talk to.  None of us has a miracle to offer you - in AA or any other program - none of us have a way to strike you sober.  You have to do the intense work to improve your life.  You have to be dedicated to it.  You have to be surrendered to it.  How you choose to go about it is entirely up to you but you have to be willing to DO it whatever it is.  You are an alcoholic and you will always be welcome in AA drunk or sober God or no God and if you want the fellowship part but not the God part so much you can still go as long as you can accept that a lot of us will talk about God.  Ignore the bleeding deacons - we're here if ever you just need a chair and a place to sit and not drink for an hour and a half.  The coffee is awful but we crack good jokes.
It sounds like you like most alcoholics myself included require more than just alcohol treatment. Alcoholism is a symptom of underlying problems whether it's depression or anxiety or schizophrenia we use alcohol to self medicate. Go to a real doctor and tell him/her you're suicidal. If those thoughts are there eventually you will do it.
I am not an alcoholic my wife is. We came out of a long period in a VERY conservative fundamentalist Christian group. AA reminds me so much of that time...the people behave the same way. "If you are not following the way I do you are not saved!" Kind of attitude. Unfortunately AA is the Wal-Mart of "recovery ". They are the easiest and most available meetings to find. My advice is to find the most liberal open meetings you can. Stay away from the "orthodox" ones and as a friend in religion once told me..."chew the meat...and spit out the gristle". Be strong in yourself...and decide what the meat is for you.
You shouldn't relate rehab to Alcoholics Anonymous because they have nothing to do with each other. Also please don't let a few bad experiences turn you off. If you really want to stop drinking you can find a sponsor who will take you through the steps. You might as well just try to get a sponsor with knowledge of the steps and go through them. If it doesn't work for you at least you tried.
I have actually! She's great and I'm giving things another chance. I know rehab and AA aren't the same. The way I see it rehab is just a safe little bubble for some people. It's not real life. Thanks for the words of encouragement though. I was just going through a rough patch. Things are much better now.
