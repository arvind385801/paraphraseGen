Good afternoon Recovery Family just wanted to post this to see if anyone else has HAD this experience and what you did with it. ..The road to recovery for me has not been without it's missteps. A funny thing has happened to me along the way though. When I got here over 10 years ago I was at deaths door lost everything dealing with a host of issues due to my using &amp; drinking. I stayed for a few years life got real good and went out for a few years...The crux of this post is this. Even when I went out I never went back (on the outside) to how bad my life had gotten in the past. My career continued to progress my Faith and walk with God grew I got married to an amazing woman. Life kept moving forward in a positive direction...After a time my alcoholism progressed and it got bad again. Worse than before (on the inside). I came back to AA and life has been even better than it was the first time. I got truly honest with myself in realizing that I REALLY couldn't drink or use. I have no intention of getting loaded for any reason especially not today...Now to get to my actual question. People say my sponsor included no big decisions in the first year. I understand the thought behind this but Dr Bob and Bill literally started this program in their first year as well as did nothing else except make major decisions. On top of that although I am physically new again in my heart I have a background of many years of experience and faith. ..Thoughts? Ideas? I'm not saying that I'm going to go and change major stuff but I'm considering a new career path that's more fulfilling and other things like that. ..Love and Light to all of you

I don't think there's anything wrong with making a career change in relatively new recovery. You've stopped anesthetizing yourself all the time and your mind may not be satisfied with the old path which makes a lot of sense. You now have a lot more mental capacity to work with and your real self is making noise. ..It may even help with recovery as you rebuild your conception of self as a new person. ..That said be prepared for a lot of stress and unanticipated challenges as you move out of your comfort zone and have a plan for dealing with it sober. ..As with anything make sure you get lots of advice and input from people who care about you. 
Kind of hard to give advice on this but I would just say that life does not stop when you get sober. If you need to make a change and have an opportunity take it. .
