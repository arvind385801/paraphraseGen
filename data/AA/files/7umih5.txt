Hi everyone! I'm new to reddit so bear with me here. I'm celebrating my 1 year of sobriety today something that I never thought I could achieve. The fellowship of AA took me in with open arms and truly saved my life. I'm so grateful to be alive today and it's all thanks to the steps and my higher power. While I'm still newly sober I hope that this gives a glimmer of hope to anyone who is struggling and looking for an answer. I promise - you will find it in the rooms!
