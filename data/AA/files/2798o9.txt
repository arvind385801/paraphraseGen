It felt good.  I've been struggling with alcohol for about 11 years now.  The entire length of my 20s is a huge blur.  I managed to get into so much trouble  ruin so many relationships  and build a pretty bad reputation for myself.  After having yet another relationship end due to my drunken behavior and finally realizing I was the problem and needed change  I decided sobriety was necessary and I needed to change my life.  I know that from here on out staying away from alcohol  following steps and being sponsored is going to help my life out a lot.  It's exciting just thinking about seeing and enjoying life through the eyes of a sober man.
