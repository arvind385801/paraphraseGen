Has she expressed a desire to stop drinking? 
Do they know AA offers a solution to this endless cycle of self sabotaging bullshit that your friend is going through?
/r/alanon there are meetings you can go to too. It's for people with loved ones that are alcoholics. 
Others mentioned AA. Of course I suggest that as well  I've been sober 8 months now through AA. But really  if he does go to a meeting  tell him that someone who got sober in AA said its very important to be honest and willing to do the work. That involves getting a sponsor  and worming the 12 steps. The AA program is not going to meetings. Its working the steps  and helping others. Meeting provide fellowship  and access to people to help. Perhaps let him know what I just told you - that if he sincerely wants it  if he's truly honest  if he gets a sponsor and works the steps  that he can and will stay sober. Good luck!
