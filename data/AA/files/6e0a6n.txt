Hey there.  Been struggling with some bad drinking habits and I was looking for someone to speak to about it.
----------immediate responses--------

Are there any AA meetings this morning in your area?  You could look up your local AA Central Office or AA Hotline number and get a person to help guide you to resources.
Okay this is a great place to get it out it's anonymous so you can be honest and not worry. .How bad is it? Drinking the whole paycheque bad? Drinking and driving and finding new dents on your car and not knowing where they came from bad? ..Losing friends because you are an ass when you drink? Having those same friends tell you not to come around if you are drunk anymore? Passing out with a full bladder from drinking so much and waking up to a wet bed? Losing your licence for drinking and driving and spending the night in jail? Starting to drink alone because you don't want to feel bad about what you said or did the next day AND you don't have to share? Uttering death threats to people while insanely drunk and incredibly angry?..I ask because these are examples from my drinking that it was getting bad and i KNEW it but didn't really want to quit drinking it was torture being there and thinking I was the only one who was like this. i came to A.A. meetings and found tons of people just like me with the same problems and......THEY HAD ANSWERS!!!!!!! 
Welcome :)
You could message me anytime we can talk I won't preach at or pressure you. If you aren't ready to stop drinking yet I'd still be honored to have a new friend.
