Sorry for the long rant post I'm lost any advice please ...Unfortunately I don't know what to do my wife is an alcoholic had a situation 13 yrs ago where she drove drunk didn't get caught ruined a car(blew the engine) prior to that was in rehab 10 yes or so before that.  Had been sober for up to 3 yrs ago and slowly started drinking during stressful times etc typical life stress money education etc.  now the last 2 yrs 3 months she started sneaking it wasn't sure but he last two years definitely she is full blown 6-18 beers a day will stop every once in a while when comforted by myself and children. But then she denies refuses etc but she has gotten so nasty violent etc I'm to the point I don't care if she does or not she makes shit up says the meanest untrue shit to our children and to me.  Has no filter etc when she drinks she has even drove our kids buzzed before I need help financially I'm lost no family nearby to help me out if I divorce she refuses to go to counseling or help or rehab refuses to tell her parents threatens kids if I let her parents or they tell them .This state is such a small area  too many people talk and can't keep their noses out of other peoples business  I'm afraid to say anything it will affect her job and definitely affect my kids lives here.I don't know what else to do I really am trying to avoid a domestic as it will probably ruin me more than her for some reason males are treated poorly and shunned when they ask for help with spouse who is alcoholic

You should definitely look into AlAnon meetings or at least the r/AlAnon sub... you'll find a lot of people there that know EXACTLY what you are going through...
You can't go on like this your physical and mental health will suffer.  Get help please.
