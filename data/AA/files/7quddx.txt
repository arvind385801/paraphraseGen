I spent 6 months working the AA program and relapsed but I'm still working for it. I really want to recover. This is priority #1. But I am not happy in my town. I want to travel the world. I have the money and the time to travel but how can I work with a sponsor while traveling? I want to go to Europe for several months Southeast Asia for several months work on farms live at buddhist monasteries etc...How can I integrate these things with AA? I know I need the program but I don't want to avoid living my life and finding my passion either. ..Do I need to plop down in one location until I finish the steps?

What do you want more? As an old sponsor of mine said go to what gives you energy...You might be able to find AA in all those places.
One thing my sponsor told me was no major life changes until at LEAST a year sober. Get situated work the steps WITH A SPONSOR (Just a suggestion but I took them as rules) get a home group (this is so important gives you a sense of belonging and responsibility) gather contacts look into service.
Head to Chiang-Mai in Thailand. Very spiritual place. Nice living. Good English speaking AA scene with meetings every day by the Nakorn Ping condos. Also NA and rehabs and a big expat community in recovery. 
I have 2 wonderful books to recommend regarding one of these trips you would like to take.  Both of these explain how Buddhism correlates and intertwines directly with our recovery...One Breath at a Time:  Buddhism and The Twelve Steps - Kevin Griffin..Mindfulness and The Twelve Steps:  Living Recovery in the Present Moment - Th r se Jacobs-Stewart
