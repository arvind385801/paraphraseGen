This always seems to happen which is why this is my favorite literature meeting..I had a serious relapse last week I went 4 days in my cave of isolation and loneliness.  These are the main reasons I drink I isolate and drink.  I spoke to no one and did not leave my apartment. Sunday night I snapped out of it (also I was freaked out because I was vomiting water for 24 hours) and made an appointment with my therapist (who I blew off Friday morning).  I saw him yesterday and we got into this and my patterns...This morning our guest chose Ch 14 "Fending Off Loneliness". As usual perfect timing and I actually spoke and explained what just happened and it's a pattern and I was glad to be in my home group discussing it with them.  I am in such a good mood and I am looking forward to tonight's 3 speaker meeting that is ALWAYS good.

God always gets the message to us !
There's nothing wrong with a bad mood as long as we don't get stuck there.
Just curious aren't they all serious relapses. Although the way they spoken of at times scares the shit out of me at times. They come in talking about them as though they got poison ivy over the weekend. No guarantee you're coming back if you go out boys and girls. Life and death.
