So I've been struggling with relapse repeatedly since getting back into the rooms a few months back.  So much to the point that last week I was drunk 6 of 7 days including 2 days of drinking AT WORK.  As if I didn't learn my lesson from recently getting fired from my previous job on account of my drinking- related bullshit.   ..I neglected to do a system check which now throws some data in question.   It's a first time  and minor mistake but one that will cause some documentation to be filed noting my negligence.   These things happen to everyone but I especially internalize failure (like a true alcoholic amirite?)  and now with even more remorse because I know alcohol was involved.  ..And though I now have 3 days sober again and felt on top of the world yesterday I have to accept my short-comings  admit to them and walk through the consequences like an adult.  ..I heard so many good things at the meeting I attended last night- if I hadn't gone I could be taking this a lot worse.   In fact I may have even lied to try and cover this up which in reality would be 1000000x worse than what I did/didn't do.  ..I'll keep coming back.  Thanks for being there everyone.  I need your support more than I can rationalize so I need to just believe it with faith.

I was a chronic relapse specialist for my first few years in AA.  Keep your desire to stop drinking high and lean on those you relate to best at meetings.  Post your feelings here if it is comfortable relish in the serenity we are all entitled to meditate and remember that our step 10 daily inventory needs to include recognizing when we are right and acknowledging it's impact also.  Have a great day one at a time.
