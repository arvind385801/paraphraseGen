Ok - I feel really out of options and I just need some advice and some help I don't know where else to turn. I've taken my mother to the doctor told all of her friends had numerous interventions with the family. She doesn't change. Here's an extremely long story cut short - with all the particularly horrible bits cut out. (when she broke her own leg when strangers practically drag her own after finding her passed out numerous hospital visits and drips pissing herself throwing up etc...) ..I'm 22 I have a brother who is 20 and a sister who is 24. We live with my mum. We have no other family - no aunties no uncles no grandparents no one at all. My dad died when I was 15 because he was an alcoholic and it eventually killed him. This took it's toll on our family but particularly my mum. She started drinking soon after he died but I do have memories of her drinking before this too - just not to such a dangerous extent. She has gotten worse throughout the years and now the situation (and her life) is diabolical. She worked her whole life and now has lost 3 jobs because of her drinking. She is now unemployed and struggling to find work. Me and my siblings pay all of the bills in the house (through fucking hard work and it's difficult - it's hard not to be bitter sometimes). This is a problem because we can't just leave - I've thought about it so many times I want to go to university I've passed all my exams.. But if I leave who will put food in the fridge? Who will pay the mortgage? She will lose the house and have no where to live. She is currently on benefits gets paid every 2 weeks and goes on a massive binge for about a week until she runs out of money and is then sober for a week. And repeat. We have tried every possible way of stopping this taking her bank card taking her purse stopping her going out etc... It doesn't work. ..The main thing I need help with and the reason I am slowing losing my mind finally after all these years is because of the SCREAMING. There isn't another word for it. She gets drunk and screams. All. Night. And. Day. It isn't crying - it's screaming. It isn't words or anything. Just senseless screams. She does it every time she's drunk. She isn't in any physical pain and I don't think it's for attention because when I sit with her and try to calm her down she carries on. Also when she does this she is barely conscious and cannot speak. IT IS DRIVING ME INSANE. There has been multiple night where I cannot sleep until 2am and then it wakes me up at 5am and I have to get up at 7am for work... It's exhausting. She seems fine when she is sober regular withdrawal symptoms of course (shaking sick etc) but mentally ok. She gets anxious but shit so do I. She hasn't always done this - it's a recent development. ..Please please please tell me someone else has experienced this. I can't find anything on google. What is with the screaming? Has she lost her mind? Should I look into getting her sectioned?

Drunk people are unreasonable as you said she is fine when she is sober so it sounds like she hasn't lost her mind but is just a completely non reasonable drunk.  Drunk people gonna act stupid its not usually a reflection of the person and yes most of them feel pretty stupid and ashamed of there actions when they sober up or possibly not remember at all because of black out drunkenness...She sounds like she is in serious need of help you should call your local aa and tell them your situation.  I don't know all the details but i think next time she is hungover they can have someone come and talk to her.  The time to talk to them is when they are hungover and not in the middle of a drinking episode...Don't take my advice alone but if it was me I would up and leave for university your mom is of full age and she is not taking responsibility for herself that is her own fault and it is a shame you are at the butt end of that.  I would let the house go and all that and her disability would be enough to get her into an apartment or something more deserving of her situation...Or next time she is hungover (in a nice way) ask her about her feelings about attending aa and things like that I can't speak for her but when I am hungover it is very hard on you emotionally so try not to be to hard on her no matter how she acted the day before...and obligatory /r/alanon .alanon is for family and friends of alcoholics.
It's heartbreaking to contemplate but I believe you're hearing from her the depths of self-loathing disappointment long held fears regrets unhappiness and loneliness she feels. I wonder why more of us don't scream to express what we feel but cannot say to anyone. She may be more perceptive than most...Consider taking your mother to an evening AA meeting. Get her there a bit early and see if she can connect with women there give them some privacy to talk. They will understand her.
Do you have access to a local Al-Anon meeting? Somewhere you can go and ask for help? Usually there's a list in the paper. There may be someone willing to help you ask local service network and get her into rehab or at least facilitate a family meeting where you can tell her what is happening. The next time she is screaming record her on your phone then you can play ten seconds or less at the meeting and then tell her this has been going on for xx number of days. She probably has no idea. Or if she partially remembers she's in such a state she can't acknowledge the harm it is causing. Be strong.
