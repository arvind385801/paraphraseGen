Being honest and direct with people without demeaning them is the best way to go about this. "I can't give you a ride because when I do you are high/under the influence and it affects my sobriety". Call me back when you're serious? Is he there getting his paper signed? I would assume anyone going to meetings is serious. I've never seen anyone come in on a winning streak. Bottom line if you don't feel comfortable giving someone a ride be honest with them and tell them as such. They aren't owed rides.
I know you say constantly that you live in steps 10 11 and 12 but you seem to swing constantly from resentment to resentment..Instead of seeing this as a burden I would try to look at this as an opportunity to do good in this person's life because it gives me time to talk to them one on one..I know I go to AA because I have a drinking problem and I also know a lot of people have a hard time "getting it". AA is terrifying for someone who is struggling. .So I shouldn't be surprised if someone there isn't yet comfortable participating instead I should set a good example..I give people rides often and some people participate and other people just listen. Do I resent them? Sometimes but it is my problem to be dealt with using the steps..Do I feel useful and happy to help people who want help? Absolutely. I would rather they went to AA than didn't go.
I would never give someone a ride who is high. 
Be sure you are taking care of yourself and your own recovery. If you feel pressured to do something that makes you uncomfortable then don't do it.
