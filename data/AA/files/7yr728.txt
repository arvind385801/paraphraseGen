For myself it was very common - once I started to drink I found I just kept going and going and going and going.  There was never enough to quench my thirst...For me it became problematic.  AA helped me stay stopped.  Check out a meeting if you are interested.
I found reading the Big Book of AA helpful in understanding some things about myself. Give it a try if you'd like... We hope we have made clear the distinction between the alcoholic and the nonalcoholic. If when you honestly want to you find you cannot quit entirely or if when drinking you have little control over the amount you take you are probably alcoholic.  Ch. 4 B.B. of AA 
I can't even have one potato chip.  I cannot drink any amount safely.  It took some time but through the 12 steps I realized moderation wasn't for me.  
It's very abnormal and uncommon among normal drinkers.
Thank you all for your feedback! Definitely going to be looking at ways to cut down. Wish you all well!
Struggling with moderation is probably something everyone experiences. Although I guess the difference with some people is that it's not a theme in their lives. But everyone has their themes id say. But not everyone spirals out and endangers there lives due to their themes...Everyone has their issues....im not a huge fan of the idea of theres alcoholics and then theres normal people. Because then everything people put under the net alcoholism in there lives  and if you've been to a meeting you know that's a wide net then somehow seems like "normies" don't go through that...So yes in terms of alcohol alcoholics have an issue. But all the other stuff including struggling w moderation outside of alcohol is pretty common to a degree.
