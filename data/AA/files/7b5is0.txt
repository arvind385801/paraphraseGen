Wow what a journey this past year has been! I've heard so many people share that @ 5yrs things started to get stale in their programs. I took that as an invitation to dive even deeper into all three legacies of my program. Recovery: Ive taken on x4 men as sponsees... All in varying places of their own recovery. Unity: Iv been blessed to carry multiple commitments at multiple homegroups and continue to show up to the business meetings to participate in our group conscience. Service: I am rotating out as our District DCM and am currently our Area Alt. Delegate Elect... I'm stoked and enthused with a fun vision for what that might look and feel like and ever thinking of those that are out there and who the hand of AA might reach. To this wonderful fellowship which is we us and ours: Thank You!!! Thank you for the safe space to make mistakes and the encouragement to thank God for them all; for the friendships and the many amends that have grown me as a man; for the vision and life in love that is so completely different than the pain suffering and struggle that was true only a few years ago. Thank you to this sub for its continuing spirit of support! I have read from this sub at multiple levels in Recovery Unity and Service and it has always been inspiring. Cheers and blessings!

Enjoyed reading this. So good to see someone carrying the message &amp; I'd have to think your personal happiness has come to some extent from that work. I just love seeing people on fire for AA!
This is awesome! Man you are on fire- I love it &amp; hope I have the same appreciation  for this sacred fellowship when I'm as far down the road as you. 
I have been sober for over 30 years and find myself more engaged with the program than ever before!  I don't think the program ever gets stale - we might allow our sobriety to get stale - but the program always is there and is able to provide us new areas of growth and recovery.  Congratulations!!
