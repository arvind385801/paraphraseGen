I have to come clean @ meeting tonight about a few relapses. My sponsor might be there & she doesn't know - as I previously told her I hadn't. Ugh.

Sunlight is the best disinfectant. You'll feel better after being honest.
Good work /u/annie9898.  Why don't you check out the /r/stopdrinking subreddit for a community of fellow sobies?
Rigorous honesty feels good!! Plus if you're an alcoholic you shouldn't have to apologize for doing what we do which is drink! It's not bad people getting good it's sick people getting well!..My sponsor says if you tell 27 lies a day then start telling 26 lies a day that's improvement!..To thine own self be true - if you're like me you're not in AA to be popular or to impress people you're there because you want to change.

Go for it the relief is going to feel amazing!  Sponsor probably knew (or suspected) anyways.
Wow good for you. With that decision made already why not call her up and talk about this before the meeting? You may get things discussed between you that won't be possible in the meeting.
I have the utmost respect for those who own up to a relapse at meetings.   They are always filled with shame.  But the group is always always always full of love and support....We've all failed many more times than we've succeeded.   Keep your head high.   We've got your back...
