Hi there..I'm part of a recovery program and in about 1 - 1.5 hours I've got to share with my group people I know very little about my relapse this weekend.  I've been in recovery for a couple months but haven't attended AA at all and I'm considering trying to squeeze in a meeting right before I've got to show up at my recovery program.  I'm also nervous about meeting the new people at an AA group.  Has anyone had similar experiences?

You're going to find a lot more AA members whose stories include relapse than those that do not.   We already know why you relapsed even if you do not know yourself.  No one will judge you for slipping and you wouldn't want anything to do with anyone who does.   We are all in this together so make yourself at home. ..
I think it's very important to talk about relapse because many relapse on their journey. They like you should know they are not alone. .What you're doing has the potential to help many people. Best to you!
I hope your honest talk at your program went well and that you found the same warm reception at AA that I found when I told the members I was new and didn't want to drink again.
I'm coming up on a week sober from a relapse and I can tell you a big part of keeping that sobriety has been sharing about it at meetings. I've also been in rehab and from my personal experience you're going to get more love and support and zero judgement in AA as opposed to in treatment...The other things that have kept me sober since my relapse? Talking to my sponsor every day going to meetings every day starting the steps again. Rehab and treatment and recovery programs are fantastic and help a lot of people but there's no substitute for working the program...So yeah go to that meeting and keep coming back we need you!
