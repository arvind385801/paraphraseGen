Anyone in Macomb Illinois that could meet up and chat with me tonight? I have nowhere to go right now and I'm struggling quite a bit.

I think there's a live chat room for stopdrinking in the side bar if you're on a computer. I don't see it on the phone app though. Hang in there. If it gets tough maybe go see a movie or take a book to a coffee house? Have you tried AA meetings in your town? People of all ages and types with one thing in common. They're not for everyone but it'll be an hour of not drinking guaranteed. 
Check out an app called Pink Cloud it s really helpful for finding meetings in a pinch.
