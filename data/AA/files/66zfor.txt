Today marks 90 days of sobriety. This isn't the first time I've been here but hopefully my last 90 days. I just want to give a message to anyone else that is here been here or not quite here yet; being sober won't fix all your problems. What it will do is at least give you a chance to make a better life that you wouldn't otherwise have if you were still boozing or using. If you feel depressed lonely sad don't turn to substances to bandaid the fundamental issues in your life. Actually feel those emotions and make a plan to fix those problems. Go to meetings join a club get a hobby go to the gym and keep busy. Boredom and loneliness are the cause of most relapses in my opinion. Just keep busy and stay sober 24 hours at a time.

Woot!!!..Well done.   90 is huge!!
Great job !! what about your experience so far? ..Do you have a home group sponsor? A commitment? 
I'm glad your giving a super effort by commitment I just meant something to do st the group like make coffee or whatever  fourth step for me was awesome btw really high life's the ridiculousness of my thoughts
Absolutely. All the stories of people 3 5 10 18 years sober that go back out scares the hell out of me. My life is pointed in the right direction and all that time and effort to get it to that point can go up in flames with one bottle. I can honestly say I fear no man I don't have the fear of god but drugs and alcohol send shivers down my spine.
Congrats man!  I'm right there with you I picked up my green chip on Wednesday.  
I think not drinking today is an achievement. No matter how bad everything else might be going to bed at night sober is something to be proud of. Congratulations. Keep it up.
