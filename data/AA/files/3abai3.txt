Hey all figured I would post here for help...I know the important thing is being sober which I have proudly stayed for the 5 months and 28 gruling days. I suffer form clinical depression and conversion disorder so it's an uphill battle each day...I have a high amount of anxiety about going back to any AA meeting in my local area (Indianapolis). I feel like I have let down others by not showing up. I also haven't collected any of my marker tokens besides my 24 hour token. I haven't done my steps. Does anyone else get this? How do you cope with it? ..I don't have a solid support structure as my dad even tried to get me to drink when i started recovery and he doesn't "understand" why I can't have a few drinks. My girlfriend drinks though not to excess and usually asks before hand if we go out. I have found that I am living vicariously through her by buying her a drink for me as well. I don't want to relapse because this is my first real time trying to be sober. ..TL:DR High anxiety about going back after not been to a meeting for 4 months.
