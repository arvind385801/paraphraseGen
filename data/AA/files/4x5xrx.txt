Lost most of my friends since I quit drinking and the crippling loneliness makes me want to relapse a lot. I can't get any dates or even find social groups because I work in restaurants and only seem to be a Tuesdays and Wednesdays off.

Seriously try an AA meeting. That's where I've met a lot of my friends since getting sober. Get there early and stay late to chat ask people to grab dinner after. AA has a lot of amazing tools but the fellowship is what really makes it special 
I made sober friends by going to AA meetings.
