I met my sponsor at my first meeting I raised my hand and said I needed a sponsor.  Without even getting to know each other we agreed she would be my sponsor and since then we get along well though I don't feel a hugely strong connection to her.  ..From the beginning she said we should talk every other day but due to our schedules it usually ends up being about two phone calls per week plus we meet every Saturday to do step work.  She usually responds if I text her but she rarely initiates texts/calls.  ..But she constantly has to cancel our Saturday meeting.  She has two kids in high school so this Saturday it's her son's basketball game last month she had to take her daughter out of town for something.  In addition a lot of it has been circumstances out of her control she had to leave town for a funeral and during that week we didn't talk much/didn't meet that Saturday. ..A few weeks ago she found out she had fluid around her heart due to a viral infection and was hospitalized for a few days and on bed rest since although she did make our Saturday meeting last weekend.  So she misses maybe 1/3 of our meetings but it's usually for good reason...Anyway last week she told me she's missing this Saturday because she has to be at her sons game so she suggested we find an hour to talk Wednesday (yesterday).  Last night by 9:00pm neither one of us has reached out so I texted asking if she's free to talk tonight or tomorrow.  I left the option open for us to talk  tomorrow  because quite honestly I just didn't think she wanted to hear from me.  She responded that she's watching the finale of her favorite show so we will talk tomorrow (today Thursday)...I woke up last night at 4 am with this bad gut feeling I thought about it the more my gut just says that this isn't working with her for weeks now I have felt like this isn't a good fit for me. ..But any time I think I'll  break up  with her I chicken out I feel guilty.  She tells me all the time how she feels like this was meant to be and like god put me in her life for a reason.  (I should add that I'm agnostic and many of my meetings are humanist meetings which de-emphasize god in favor of the power of the group itself I really like these meetings! It's the first time I've felt at home in AA as an agnostic person.)..I should note that this isn't dire I am doing very well going to meetings daily and this isn't something where I am going to go out and drink tonight if I don't hear from her.  I would rather approach this correctly that call her tonight on impulse.  It's just something I realized last night I am really struggling with. There's a woman in my humanist meetings I really relate to and we talk a lot but I'm scared to ask her advice...I'm worried she will assume I'm basically trying to get her to sponsor me and I'll get rejected. I feel silly.  ..So I'm kinda lost.  Is this normal? Is a sponsor supposed to call ME or am I supposed to be the one to reach out/schedule meetings etc? ..Anyway I think I know what I have to do but I need help particularly in navigating what to say to her. I don't want to upset her humiliate her chew her out (the funeral and health stuff cane as a surprise to her and I don't expect her to ignore her health!) but I dunno. It took me a long time to finally embrace this program in part because I have trust issues and in part because I struggle with the god stuff...so it just feels like this is not a good match...Any advice would be great!

Generally speaking we contact our sponsors and not the other way 'round.  Unfortunately it seems like this woman doesn't have time to dedicate to another alcoholic ... so shouldn't be sponsoring people...What you say to her will be simple as long as you are honest and respectful :)  Has she helped you so far?  Are you feeling like she doesn't have time for you anymore?  Do you want to move forward through the steps?  That's all it takes: I appreciate what you've done but it seems you've got a lot on your plate and I want to move forward so I'm going to find someone else to help me...Oh by the way it is quite normal to change sponsors.  It ain't like a match made in heaven till death do us part type of thing: its just one alcoholic asking another for some help :)
I would ask advice from the lady you are clicking with in the other meeting.  Typically the sponsee calls the sponsor.  I talk to my sponsor once a week and we met about once a week as I was going through the steps for the first time.  But different people are different.  It sounds like your sponsor is very busy and yet still setting time aside for you.  But if you need more time to meet with a sponsor since it is early in sobriety then do what you feel is right.  Be open and honest and you will be okay.  I know that you are agnostic but when I am uncertain on a decision I pray about it.  Whatever is out there it helped me to try to be mindful of this immense power that connects all of us.
