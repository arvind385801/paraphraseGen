I've been struggling with this in the past few weeks. I love the idea of what u/wedorecover12 is doing. I love the availability of speaker "tapes". It is carrying the message which is how we survive/stay sober. However the constant submissions feels like advertisement and promotion which isn't a good thing. You can take a quick glance at their facebook page as well and it's the same thing (actually looks like they have is automatically submitting the same post over and over). If you view this subreddit alone you'll see what I'm talking about. ..Should the mods be looking at this? Is something like this acceptable for this subreddit? Am I totally crazy and alone on this one?

To see content of this sub you either need to be subscribed or you intentionally come to this sub.  You are totally crazy 
Just came over to submit another speaker to this sub and saw your post.  We do want people to know about our channel because the speakers we host have helped a ton of people and we get messages saying so all the time.  We only try to get the word out about our channel to those that we know are already involved in a 12 step fellowship.  We use Hootsuite to submit those posts because Facebook doesn't allow you to reach much of your audience without having to pay and we have lives.  We've noticed that our submissions take up a lot of space in this sub but that's because not a lot of other people are posting not because that's our goal.  Out of the 1138 readers on this sub we'd love to see more posts by other members!!  Also we don't plan on trying to post our entire catalog on reddit we only post the speakers that people enjoy the most.  It just happens that there are quite a few really good ones!  Ultimately if the mods want us to stop posting that's what we will do.   We don't want to cause any problems out there only solutions!
