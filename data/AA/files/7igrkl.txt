I'm really struggling with anxiety and depression. I just feel miserable about letting my drinking control me. I have kept myself from doing drugs for two weeks (big deal for me) but now my need to drink is back. I feel like the ups and downs are constant.

all i can say is find a meeting and drink some water if you can. be kind to yourself it gets better if you work on it. most of all hang in there!
I couldn't stay sober without the help of a therapist. Get a professional to work with you.
