Some background; F29 Sober 1 year worked my first set of steps. I have a therapist working on outside issues a church family for spiritual issues and my sponsor (F50s) for program guide. ..I picked my now sponsor out about three months ago. I chose her because I have PTSD and she had helped me a lot as a friend and seemed to have good sobriety. She also has 3 years sober and seemed like a safe woman. My previous sponsor and I just got too close and she is now my best friend. My current boyfriend and I have had our fair share of struggles but now are in a very healthy place we both have therapy and we are both open and honest with each other. .My problem is that I'm starting to see a pattern of her being what I would consider extremely negative towards others she doesn't approve of. (I've noticed this more with men but have also heard her talk bad about women) I'm starting to feel extremely uncomfortable sharing anything with her because if I talk about someone she doesn't like the conversation always ends up with talking about all the worst things of that person. Last night she asked me how my relationship was doing and I told her great but more importantly I was really working on myself and felt very empowered by my therapist and that I was really making progress with my confidence. She seemingly randomly started tearing into the fact that right now my boyfriend and I are choosing to be abstinent  (our own personal reasons that we are dealing with in therapy) She went as far as to say that he was "too damaged and will never get better" I was really angry and took aback by that especially because we have had dramatically positive changes in our relationship and my therapist has told me that our relationship is quite healthy at this point. I realize our sponsors are supposed to be guides to our program and not our therapy or relationship guide. That being said I dont know if I'm being unreasonable by thinking of completing changing sponsors because of this pattern of negativity and bashing people I care a great deal for. Anyone with some time and sponsor/sponsee knowledge have any advice?

You know what to do. It sounds like you are looking for somebody else to confirm what you already know: drop this sponsor...The 12 steps help us overcome are character defects by bringing us closer to our spirituality. Spirituality is not about being negative or judgmental. Do you really want to have somebody like this to help guide you in your journey? A negative and judgmental person will only slow you down on your journey...Just my opinion. Good luck..
We don't have all the information so it's hard for me to be confident in my assessment but here it is...Yes the sponsor is supposed to guide us in the program no they're not a therapist.  But the program is all about our relationships.  So part of guiding us in our program is helping us with relationships...That being said the the program is all about looking at our own faults and how to make them better.  It really doesn't have much to to do with the other person and their faults.  So in my opinion she shouldn't be judging your BF.  ..That being said: we still don't have the full story.  My opinion would be subject to change based on the lacking information.  
She sounds like a nut. Life's too short for snarky negative people.
Get a new sponsor - no big deal. That's the great thing about our program.
Hey btw - sounds like you're doing great really admire your commitment. I have my first therapy appt. on Monday - finally.
I'm about to "fire" my sponsor but I don't know how to do it politely.  We glossed over half of the steps and it's bothered me for awhile.  We also have very different views on spirituality.  And he has given me bad advice on who to make amends to.  I was told that sponsors and sponsees can "fire" each other at any time.
You made the wise move from what you have said.  I can only go by what your understanding of it was so I will.  I had a couple references pop up for me... so.....Here's two hard hitting (for me) sections from the 12 and 12 that I like and it addresses these kinds of issues.....***Even A.A. old timers sober for years often pay dearly for skimping this Step. They will tell how they tried to carry the load alone; how much they suffered of irritability anxiety remorse and depression; and how unconsciously seeking relief they would sometimes accuse even their best friends of the very character defects they themselves were trying to conceal. They always discovered that relief never came by confessing the sins of other people. Everybody had to confess his own.***  (from Step 5)..AND..***Finally we begin to see that all people including ourselves are to some extent emotionally ill as well as frequently wrong and then we approach true tolerance and see what real love for our fellows actually means. It will become more and more evident as we go forward that it is pointless to become angry or to get hurt by people who like us are suffering from the pains of growing up. Such a radical change in our outlook will take time maybe a lot of time. Not many people can truthfully assert that they love everybody. Most of us must admit that we have loved but a few; that we have been quite indifferent to the many so long as none of them gave us trouble; and as for the remainder well we have really disliked or hated them. Although these attitudes are common enough we A.A.'s find we need something much better in order to keep our balance. We can't stand it if we hate deeply. The idea that we can be possessively loving of a few can ignore the many and can continue to fear or hate anybody has to be abandoned if only a little at a time. We can try to stop making unreasonable demands upon those we love. We can show kindness where we had shown none. With those we dislike we can begin to practice justice and courtesy perhaps going out of our way to understand and help them. Whenever we fail any of these people we can promptly admit it to ourselves always and to them also when the admission would be helpful. Courtesy kindness justice and love are the keynotes by which we may come into harmony with practically anybody.*** (from Step 10**)**..So just because someone is emotionally ill which your ex-sponsor may be does not mean that we have to be harmed by them.  We can however understand with tolerance what led them there and let ourselves not be haunted if we had to move away from their sharp or harmful behaviors...Best to you.
You're doing awesome. Just the fact that you posted here shows you're working the program checking in with other alcoholics and sharing your feelings about something that didn't feel right. Keep doin the deal! This whole sobriety thing is a series of learning opportunities :)
