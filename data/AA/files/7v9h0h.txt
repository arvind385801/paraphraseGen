Ive been an alcoholic for a few years already. Ive struggled with sobriety on and off for a while. I really wouldn't take the meetings to seriously but im tired of having my ass kicked everyday when i drink. Im tired of being hungover and feeling like i can't do anything because i either smell like alcohol or im just drunk or hungover. This too shall pass. One day at a time. I hope i meet some good people at this meeting. Wish me luck!

Good luck. Get a sponsor. work the steps.
It takes more than luck to get well. I started by getting a therapist and going to AA meetings. Working the steps with a sponsor was a powerful experience and changed my life. There is more to sobriety than simply not drinking. 
How did it go? 
It's not luck.  Get a sponsor work the steps.  You never have to drink again. 
I've done 5 meetings in 3 days after a relapse myself.  Looking for a home base and sponsor.   I never  repeat  never thought I'd be this AA person for tons of stupid reasons.  But I surrender!   And I'm willing to do anything and everything it takes for my recovery.  And they have been exactly that I need.  IWNDWYT 
Man walking through the door of that first meeting is tough. Don't drink. Stick around. Work the steps. You don't have to live in misery anymore. 
Good attitude. The difference between you and those sober members is the actions they've taken. Suggest you take them too.
How's today going?
