I have 100+ days sober and last night I had my first drinking dream (that I remember).   I hid the fact that I was drinking from my friends in my dream.  Ugh the struggle continues-  here's to sober living!

I remember having those early on...my sponsor asked me if I ever dreamed of drinking before I got sober. I said no I didn't think so. He said "Well that's because your drinking has become a nightmare."..Not really sure if it makes sense but it did at the time. 
Makes sense 
I haven't had one in years but my wife who is also sober has still had one now and then.  The last one she had was just a month ago.  We were out of town at a hotel and when she woke up in the morning she was disoriented and asked me why I let her drink the night prior.  After I explained where we were and what we did she snapped out of it and realized it as a dream.  The crazy things our minds can do.  Congratulations on your time friend.
