I am the daughter of an alcoholic. I need a safe place to talk about my father. Does anyone know if I can go to an AA meeting just to talk and maybe get some advice on handling myself when I'm with my dad? I'm really struggling with my feelings right now.

You sound like an adult - so you might also benefit from an organization called Adult Children of Alcoholics. It's a support group that provides education support and local meetings (you'd have to check your area). You can find out more here: http://www.adultchildren.org/..Good luck with your journey.
Alanon is the exact community you need. They are the support group for families and friends of alcoholics.  .You should be able to find a meeting in your area online. 
Please see /r/Alanon. This is not the place nor is an AA meeting. Alanon meetings are for family and friends of alcoholics. They are almost everywhere. There is also /r/AdultChildren. 
Alanon is the support group for people with loved ones that have addictions. However there are certain AA meeting that are open to everyone.
I am the alcoholic in my family and go to Alanon to be around my "normal" kid. It will be very helpful for you I am sure.
