Im sure a bot will delete this before anyone gets to read it but in case it doesnt get deleted here  goes ( p.s. i am on mobile so sorry for grammar and format). Here goes...I believe I used to be an alcoholic i drank to get drunk to forget things that are happening and it ruined my forst marruage. I ended it the ampubt of times I had g9ne to the clubs and been unfaithful us uncountable all while drinking..Since the separation i have settled dow  and had kids with a new wife her dad was an abusive alcoholic so she hates drinking and fair enough. However i still get the urge to drink and when she works nights i often relapse knowing i will be well asleep before she gets home ( i dont mean get shitfaced 3 4 or 5 drinks ovrr4-5 hours). I still stay sober in case of an emergency with the kids but i dont want it to get out of control. .I still feel a dependance on alcohol I cant go to groups beacuse theres no time left in the day does anyo e have any advise?.. Im happy to elaborate more if a bot doesnt delete this. .Genuinely looking for help ..Thanks

Thanks for sharing! It sounds like you still have some emotional baggage from your heavier drinking days. Often that plays a big role in making people drink. To get involved in a program that helps you to get that baggage out provides you with effective tools for sobriety and a solid support system of people in recovery is my suggestion. Of course the medical literature is clear that A.A. is by far the most effective program that does that. I'm a very busy guy but I make the time for A.A. because if I didn't I would be drinking again in no time and accomplishing zero.
I don't think there's any "used to be an alcoholic".  Alcoholism is a fatal disease left untreated.  So do you want untreated alcoholism or life?  It's fairly simple.
