I just wanted to introduce myself I'm 14 days sober and my alcoholism began 10 years ago. My wife recently asked for a separation due to my constant aloofness and occasional relapses. I tried to stop for a year but would obsess about alcohol and the next time I could sneak getting drunk. After I went home and relapsed the last time she had enough and asked for a separation (now she's talking divorce but hasn't filed...yet). I saw my life crumbling and had a revelation that my obsession over alcohol had been a symptom of all my insecurities and fears. Whether she leaves me or not (still living together she's gone for 10 days with her cousin's family in Florida) is irrelevant to my sobriety. If it's meant to be it's meant to be. I can't fix anyone but myself and alcohol has been my obsession for 7 years. I'm pretty young (28) to be going to AA but I don't care. I have a sponsor and have made 16 meetings in the last 14 days. I'm glad there's a subreddit for AA thanks for reading. Easy does it.

Hello and welcome! Kudos for two weeks! One day at a time was comforting and workable especially in early sobriety. Keep going to meetings and get a sponsor. You are not the youngest in AA; anyway the disease doesn't care about age...Check out /r/stopdrinking too. 
Welcome.  That's a long time between drinks for one of us. You must be doing something right. . Keep doing it.  
Welcome. Stay for the miracle...I love you bro/sis.
Good for you man.  Better now than later.  Just remember that it's going to be a REALLY hard fight and you may relapse before you get totally sober.  But it's worth it.  You can do it. 
I'm allergic to alcohol I break out in handcuffs !!  I'm Doug and  I'm an alcoholic.
Welcome!!    
I just got here yesterday. Hope you're still going strong. My situation is just like yours
