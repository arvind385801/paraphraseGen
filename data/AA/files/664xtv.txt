I am traveling to Porto Portugal at the end of the week and was hoping to find and English speaking AA meeting.  I am struggling heavily with the AA website.  If there is no English AA I would settle for an English NA or any AA meeting.

The EU AA site seems to be pretty functional for me. https://alcoholics-anonymous.eu/meetings/?tsml-day=any&amp;tsml-region=715 They might not have an English speaking meeting. You can always reach out to the area contacts and see if they can help. https://alcoholics-anonymous.eu/contact-us/regional-officers-contact-details/
My girlfriend went to Portugal a couple of years ago and contacted the General Service office. They sent her a few scans of the English meeting schedule:..http://imgur.com/lN7rLoo.http://imgur.com/dv6oqaM.http://imgur.com/wvFnL5f..You might also try emailing international@aa.org..Good luck brother and enjoy your trip!
Try GA OA. Any of those as. They all work. Good luck.
