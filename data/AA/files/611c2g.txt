Just got the news that a friend was found dead last night. I'm gutted by this. He brought me to my first meeting back in 2004 when he was just 3 months sober. He remained sober for 10 years but relapsed a few years ago. He tried on several occasions to get back into recovery buy somehow just couldn't do it. He was a brilliant musician wit and PhD in science. But that's all gone now. Alcoholism takes another soul.

So sorry for your loss. 
Everyone deserves joy and dignity. Alcohol steals this...Sorry for your loss. I think you honour your friend by remembering the good in him.
Yes I am sorry to hear this too the only useful thing to take away is not to take sobriety for granted and realize how serious the stakes can be. ..Try to remember the good things can you tell me the story of him taking you to your first meeting? I would like to hear it.
I am sorry..My heart goes out to you his friends family and those that love him. 
I lost 3 people just like that last year. I'm sorry. One day at a time
I don't like up voting this. ..Alcoholism is no joke. Pay homage to his legacy and life by continuing your journey in recovery. You have another angel. ..Peace and love. 
My condolences. I lost a brilliant person in my life to alcohol too. Young life very unfortunate.
He sounds like a great man. He was a blessing to you. 
thanks for all of your kind replies
Sad loss he likely was a positive in other lives as well as in yours.
