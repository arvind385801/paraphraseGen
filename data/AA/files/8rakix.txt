I made my first thirty days but relapsed!  I am so frustrated and ashamed!  I never post just thought maybe it would be therapeutic.

It's called doing a Fifth Step...I was very ashamed when I relapsed but I was at a meeting the next day and someone else came clean so i felt like I had to...You know how to stay sober for one day and that's all you need to know...
Keep coming back. Steps sponsor meetings.
Go to a meeting today and get a sponsor today. Start working the steps ASAP 
I'm going to one at 7:30. There is someone I want to ask to sponsor me but I am a little nervous about putting him on the spot
Did you get a sponsor and we're you working the steps?  That's the secret to success.  Anything else is just hanging out.
