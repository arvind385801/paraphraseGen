THE FALSE COMFORT OF SELF-PITY..Self-pity is one of the most unhappy and consuming defects that we know. It is a bar to all spiritual progress and can cut off all effective communication with our fellows because of its inordinate demands for attention and sympathy. It is a maudlin form of martyrdom which we can ill afford...  AS BILL SEES IT p. 238..The false comfort of self-pity screens me from reality only momentarily and then demands like a drug that I take an ever bigger dose. If I succumb to this it could lead to a relapse into drinking. What can I do? One certain antidote is to turn my attention however slightly at first toward others who are genuinely less fortunate than I preferably other alcoholics. In the same degree that I actively demonstrate my empathy with them I will lessen my own exaggerated suffering..
