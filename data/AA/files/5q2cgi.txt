A couple of times a month a lady shows up at our small bigbook meeting. She was sober for a short time last year. Now she turns up drunk and disruptive. She goads people about drink constantly interrupts people when they are sharing and insults people. What can we as a group do? Should we let her monopolise the meeting when she wants? Kick her out? We have tried reasoning with her but it falls on deaf (and drunk) ears. Any experience with this would be very welcome. ..Ed: Staring? It should be sharing.

She is not welcome to be disruptive. You can tell her either sit quietly or leave. If she interrupts the meeting you can stop the meeting and ask her/escort her out. She should not be allowed to share if she is drunk or being harmful to others so cut off her sharing if she appears to do either. I would tell her this before the meeting but assuming she comes in late and leaves early then address it during the meeting. 
We have had to call to popo and haul them out. Sad but we have to do what is best for the fellowship. 
The only requirement is a sincere desire to stop drinking. She doesn't seem sincere to me. 
In the meetings I have attended I was told that you can show up drunk but you can't be disruptive. 
Showing up drunk is fine - I have been in many. many meetings where someone is drunk.  These are the people that need help the most - the still suffering addict...Being disruptive is not fine and she should be told to leave if she is creating issues for the group.
When this has happened at meetings I've been at the topic kind of changes to fit the situation. Like how serious a person is what extremes have we been through to stay sober. Not talking directly to the person or "table talking" more of a." if the shoe fits...."I've seen several people leave and even come back sober the next time
