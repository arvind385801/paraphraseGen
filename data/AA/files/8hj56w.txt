Maybe it's time?
AA will be here when you finally concede that you cant drink like other people. It was for me. .  I hope they happens for you before something really bad happens. 
In all serious neess. How would i start? Yes im inebreiated but thankfully im at home with no way of leaving. It would be helpful to wake up  tomorrow with a sense of direction on how to get help. Thank a you.
Thanks you and god bless you
You don't have to tell me where you live. But you can google your local intergroup. Call someone and ask them where the nearest AA meeting is. You yourself could google the meetings but it may be hard to get yourself to go to one. How willing are you? Have you had enough of drinking? It's okay to show up to a meeting drunk although not preferable. 
Hiya thanks for checking in. If it gets bad there is a solution. Not everyone drinks like we do. My wife and many of my friends can party hard and then not touch the stuff for months. They don't even think about it. But me geez. Every time I drank bad things started to happen and even worse I could never stop. ..Anyway like I said thanks for sharing. If it starts to get bad and you can't stop it no matter how much you try and no matter how bad it gets we'll be here.
