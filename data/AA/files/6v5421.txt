Vent: I'm a bartender and I worked a wedding the other day. I took a sip from the wrong cup and accidentally drank a little gin and didn't realize it til the aftertaste hit me.  I immediately stopped and I told someone in the program about it.  Then I carried on my shift. .So ...Last night I had the craziest nightmares about relapsing. It was so vivid. In my dream I glugged a huge cup of a cranberry screwdriver among other drinks and wasn't getting drunk..Let that be a lesson for me: even though I've been sober awhile I still got alcoholism.

I commend your honesty. I hope this event does not end up derailing you. Keep talking and praying about it.
I think that having a nightmare about relapsing is a healthy sign. If you fear for your sobriety then it's a thing that you value...Dreaming about drinking again and the "good times" would be an unhealthy dream in my opinion...Good luck
Thanks for sharing. Something similar happened to me in early sobriety and it freaked me out. Accidents can happen especially if alcohol is within arm's reach.
