I was so nervous to go. But I made it. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming. I didn't share for my first meeting but listened to everyone story. I realized maybe I'm not alone and I'm not the only one.  Everyone has their struggle. I plan on going back tomorrow to keep the consistency.  Thank you everyone's encouraging words!   let the journey being.

Keep coming back! It gets better.
Great job! The best thing I found about AA was that I certainly wasn't alone and that even tho we were all different and had different experiences we were still all SO similar. We felt the same. AA has changed my life in so many ways. ..I'm proud of you for going. Keep coming back it will change your life if you let it! 
Bravo!
Nice! You certainly are not alone. Welcome home.
First meeting takes a lot of bravery - congratulations to you!  Very impressive.  
Well done!!
Yay you! That's awesome! Keep going back!  
One thing that I love about meetings is that I'm walking into a room full of people who understand all the good and bad things about my disease my sobriety my recovery and my program from experience..After 7 years that feeling hasn't diminished at all. 
Outstanding start! Keep your momentum  going..
I felt the same way at my first meeting and I haven't been alone again for the past 5.5 sober years.  Welcome.
