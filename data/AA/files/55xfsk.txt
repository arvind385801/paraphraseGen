I have a friend who is abusing suboxone and adderall but it prescribed by his doctor - he'll take too much on some days and run out on others. He also sells it and uses the drugs in order to trade for other things sometimes...He still collects chips at AA and NA meetings which to be fair is his business. In his mind he hasn't relapsed because he is prescribed the drugs...Anyway in regards to AA and NA has he relapsed?

I think most would agree that: yes. You are "allowed" to take prescription bills "as proscribed" by a health care professional. Taking more would be considered a relapse...What concerns me however is if he is "running out" of suboxone. The withdrawals from that are terrible. I wouldn't be shocked to discover he's finding a black market fix for dry days
Sadly yes. 
I'd say that typically it's okay to take prescription medication but his behavior says that he is abusing it and has relapsed. I can have a prescription for Oxys but that doesn't mean that I'm not abusing them. 
What he's doing doesn't work out well longterm. People who show up too loaded to make sense eventually blow out and go back to their old lives. Sad to watch but nothing can be done for them.
Yes he has relapsed
He relapsed.
Those who do not recover are those incapable of being honest with themselves.
