I'm currently trying to kick my alcohol problem and it's been really tough. I'd just like to thank all you guys in this community for your positivity and support. I had a tough last couple of days and after leaving a post asking for advice regarding this the support I got was amazing. I really feel like you guys are genuinely supporting me and I really hope that some day I'll be able to do the same for some other redditor going through the same struggles that I am now. I did not drink today and I pushed  through 2 very tough days ! Thanks to you awesome guys. .Thank you sincerely.

Quitting is really tough so if you want to check out a VERY active subreddit devoted to quitting head on over to r/stopdrinking.  ..They saved my life and along with AA were the two sharpest tools in my toolbox. Seriously. You'll be hard pressed to find a more supportive collection of rogues anywhere on Reddit.  
Thanks will check it out friend !
