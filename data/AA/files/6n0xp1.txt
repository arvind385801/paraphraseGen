I've been reading a lot of posts here to get myself back to where I need to be. I know I should be back in meetings. I've been going back down the dark path that I was in for five years. I recently got out of rehab and went 153 days clean and sober before I started fucking up again. I am also bipolar so I deal with that. I've been in too many mental hospitals and I know right now what I am doing is just putting me back into my lost lonely place again. I know what I need to do. I just wanted to put this out there so if there is anyone that is struggling like me... They can read this and know that we're both in it together. Hell all of us are in it together. Thanks for letting me share.
