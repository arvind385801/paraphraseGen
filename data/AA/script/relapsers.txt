sarattheolive,Recent relapse,Hello fellow AAs. I had a recent relapse with a concurring DUI. I'm filled with shame and regret. I'm not making it to meetings. The inner dialogue is quite sick these days. I do have a sponsor but she just lost her best friend so I am trying to not impede on her current healing or space. I'm lost and would appreciate some helping words.,1,8xm8j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8xm8j9/recent_relapse/,3,2018-07-10T02:20:17
TmobileOwesMeMoney,7 years sober,Hey! You can have this life too. I am seven years sober never relapsed and I am no longer a shitty person. I had a credit score in the high 300s quit jobs every few months drank all the time and I was unreliable. I got a sponser that had a sponser and went to meetings nightly instead of bars. ..Now I have a 4 year degree and I am a teacher full time. Pay is low but I can pay all my bills and my credit score is finally 745! I am reliable and always show up to appointments work and church. I go to meetings weekly but I used to go to several a day...My life is great. I'm not happy about everything but I keep my side of the street clean daily. That is all I can do. Hope this helps someone wondering if they can do it.,1,8x7v6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8x7v6p/7_years_sober/,18,2018-07-08T23:58:36
mauiki,Does one drink count as a relapse?,After detoxing in December I've remained completely sober until last night. I really just missed the taste of wine and had a few sips during a beautiful dinner with friends. It had no effect on me during or after it was merely for the palate. I definitely have no desire to drink today but alcohol is alcohol. .Does this count as a relapse? . .. ..,1,8x2qmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8x2qmp/does_one_drink_count_as_a_relapse/,111,2018-07-08T12:45:39
thrownaway33487,If you have secretly relapsed... Don't be ashamed... Forgive yourself reach out to someone and come back,A friend confided in me that they have been secretly using and drinking for the past couple of months. The guilt and shame has kept them out of the rooms and they haven't talked to anyone... Just isolating and beating themselves up about it...I've been taking them to meetings and just being an ear for them to vent to. I don't say this to brag I say this cause their secret almost killed them and I don't want for anyone...The bottom line is that we have all relapsed many times we just didn't have a program to go or chips to pick up before joining AA. Don't let shame or guilt keep you out... Tell someone... Come back... Keep trying... You never have to do this alone...May God bless you and keep you till then,1,8x0tql,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8x0tql/if_you_have_secretly_relapsed_dont_be_ashamed/,19,2018-07-08T07:24:17
ferretface26,I am so grateful to be an alcoholic,At tonight's AA meeting the topic was "There is a solution". It struck a chord with me because when I came into AA over two years ago I was so desperate for a solution to my drinking. Instead AA has given me a solution for *living*...For about eight years I thought I drank because I was unhappy. For the last three years I started thinking I was unhappy because I drank. Through AA I've learnt that neither are exactly true. I drank and I was unhappy because I suffered from untreated alcoholism. Sometimes receiving a diagnosis is the first step in getting well. ..I have chronic pain and for years I and my doctors have searched for a cause. I've had blood tests xrays etc and today my diagnosis is "unspecified chronic pain query cause". And while everyone thought I should be happy with every negative result because it meant that I didn't have fractures or rheumatoid arthritis or lupus the truth was every time all I heard was "we still don't know what's wrong with you". If it had been any of those awful things at least there would have been a clear way forward a treatment plan. ..Through AA I have learnt about the disease of alcoholism. And AA has offered me a method of treatment a prescription for living. I've come to learnt that alcohol was a symptom of a bigger problem and that simply putting it down wasn't enough. And that sucked at the beginning because all I wanted to be taught was how not to drink. But today I'm so incredibly grateful because through working a simple program with other alcoholics my life is fuller and more amazing than anything I could have dreamed of...At tonight's meeting there was someone who was on their third day sober; another member had returned from a relapse with 5 days; another was celebrating a year; another was celebrating 28 years. We all drank differently and appear to have very different lives and stories. But we all have two things in common: we're alcoholic and there is a solution for all of us. ..Keep coming back SD IWNDWYT,1,8x0pg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8x0pg9/i_am_so_grateful_to_be_an_alcoholic/,3,2018-07-08T06:55:38

imnotinatheater,Steps to take when you were close to a relapse?,I'm newly sober and I went to the grocery store. While at check out the lady in front of me was buying 6 bottles of liquor a case of beer and a six pax. I became VERY transfixed on it. I never met a slower cashier in my life than I did in that moment. She bagged the items so slowly I swear it was almost on purpose. Immediately I thought I should just push my cart to the side and grab a couple bottles myself- screw this whole AA thing. It was so hard to stand there with my cart of groceries but at the same time I felt frozen. I was even sweating (out of anger as weird as it sounds). I just wanted out of there. Now that it's all over and my groceries are in the cupboard I just feel exhausted- but I feel like I need to do something because I was too close to a relapse. Any suggestions?,1,8wmmee,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8wmmee/steps_to_take_when_you_were_close_to_a_relapse/,15,2018-07-06T14:47:38
alicehall93,Hit rock bottom last night. Accepted it tonight.,Hey everyone. First post here. I'll keep this fairly short as I'm headed to bed soon but I need to write this down and be held accountable...My first stint at sobriety was when I was 18 years old. I made it a bit over 2 years and relapsed pretty badly. Got sober again for a few months and didn't maintain it after that. I didn't "fully" relapse because I had "control" of the situations. If I felt like I needed to drink or wanted to drink too much I would back off and start again when it felt like I had got a handle on the situation. I did this for about 3 years. I was basically playing Russian Roulette with my "sobriety" or alcoholism...This last year I didn't have control over anything nor did I try to. I just let all of my recovery and recovery techniques slip out of my mind. I'm now in full relapse. Not the back and forth relapse I've been playing with these last few years but full blown destructive relapse. Square one on the recovery process. The only difference is this time I know I *have* to stay in recovery. I can not play games with alcoholism. I am not bigger than it is. I am not in control of it. I can pretend for months even years but at the end of the day I am an alcoholic. It is who I am and I can let that be my defining trait or I can fix this again one last time. And that's what I'm going to do. My day one starts today (it's 1:40am). I am officially and indefinitely in recovery and I'm going to make it last this time...Thanks for listening. I look forward to being a part of this community as there are no local AA meetings I can attend.   ,1,8w8cao,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8w8cao/hit_rock_bottom_last_night_accepted_it_tonight/,5,2018-07-05T02:40:18
spider_fly,4th Step Help / Guidance Please...,5 months is approaching for me. I relapsed just a few days after my 4 month coin in February. I've since found and accepted a higher power and am more than ready for a solid 4th step (first time). I have Back to Basics which is helpful but could really use some guidance on how to go about this step. I do not cut corners and I do not want the easier softer way.

imnotinatheater,Relaspes,Hey guys! I'm 3 months sober and brand new to AA. I've been struggling with this question on my mind. Is it in evitable that we will relapse at some point  in our recovery? ..Thanks for any feedback. For me personally- I have a sponsor who I call daily and work the steps with. I go to 1 meeting a day and have been for almost all 3 of those months. Relapse is always in the corner of my mind and when I start to think of it I tell on myself to my support group of people from AA not my enablers. My disease talks to me sometimes and says this is all for not because at some point you're gonna screw up. I've been praying to my higher power to take the obsession and the craving..Thanks again!

wmason49,11 days,11 days sober from a six year drunk I hold my head up high I don't put on a front. On my way up the mountain you can see me from far only light I can see is god my only star. This journey is just the beginning in which I hope is never ending. The power the mindset the emotions I feel where has this been I hope this is real. My mind is returning my body is repairing I thank so much my wife for always caring. Her silent prayers her words of inspiration she knew the battles I was constantly facing. She didn't turn she didn't run away at most time she knew exactly what to say. Yes it is hard turning away from something so long but I'm seeing clearer now this is my song. From the pop of the top to down the hatch so many times lost I don't want to relapse. Gotta keep it together gotta stay strong I can do this I've already went this long. Nothing can bring me down for I am the tiger I grab it and roar and let it know I'm a fighter. The happiness of the bottle I can find in life. I have it right beside me it's my daughter and wife. Another one on the way thank you god for this beautiful gift hopefully from now on I can continue to lift. Lift myself higher than ever before no more black nights and women from unknown sores. For I am the mountain you can try but ur not bringing me down from this day on I'll never see me on the ground. I am me and I am who chooses my fate I just hope others will see it before it's to late. Stay strong stay positive and never have doubt for alcohol is one thing I promise you can live without. ,1,8ukx8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8ukx8y/11_days/,19,2018-06-28T12:19:21
stagiana,Sober Miletone Birthday Ideas?,Tomorrow I'll have 30 days sober and Saturday I turn 40.  The only thing I wanted/asked for was a 40th bday party and my husband tried but almost all of my friends were unavailable that day so he was trying to plan something for the following Saturday.  Which was disappointing I guess because it felt like a waste of a mileatone birthday opportunity on a Saturday.  How often does that happen??..Anyway...so then my dad passed away I was hanging onto sanity by a thread and a misunderstanding led to my mom (they were divorced) cutting me off for about a week because she thought I challenged her rights as beneficiary on his life insurance.  I did not and I was able to prove it but there was still a lot of damage done.  At that point I completely spiraled out of control.  I had my husband cancel the party he was working on because I was devastated all the way around and just wanted to disappear...I drank myself stupid for a couple weeks was diagnosed with an adjustment disorder and put on FMLA from work by my psychiatrist. I completely lost control of my drinking and myself.  I stopped "sobering up" and started withdrawing instead.  I knew I had to stop or I was going to go to sleep one night and not wake up...With encouragement from my cousin (one of my closest friends and an absolute sweetheart with an unfortunate amount experience in her young life being aversely affected by others' substance abuse) I decided I needed to get help.  I was already off work so no excuse there my dad was no longer depending on me and my family needed me to get my life and myself under control much more than they needed me physically available...With almost a month behind me I AM doing better.  But only a couple days ahead of my birthday that old familiar depression and self-pity I feel most of the time when I'm "normal" is taking over.  My dad is gone.  My brother passed away 4 years ago.  My mom sprained her ankle and has chronic back problems so she's not up for much. My daughter is with her dad for the summer.  My cousin has plans with her family and in-laws this weekend.  My best friend and her husband extended their vacation (which I was counting on ending tomorrow) and they won't be here.  My husband wanted to take me kayaking but now it's looking like thunderstorms all day.  I used to go to karaoke a lot and a good friend is running a karaoke show that night (at a bar but not a party scene) and my stepfather and husband said they'll go but neither will sing - which kind of just feels like I'm burdening them.  Just about everyone else I normally see there/ hang out with is unavailable that night...I'm feeling pretty lonely and beat up.  The year has been hell since my dad started declining in december - I am his only living child and my daughter and I qere his only local family so I have been responsible for everything.  I've also lost an uncle and two friends since January and only two people from work have kept up with me since dad died and I went on leave (one retired last Friday while I was still out...I go back Monday).  The group at IOP says I should not go to karaoke because it's at a bar. The alternative is sitting home feeling sorry for myself which I think is a bigger risk for relapse. I don't like going to the movies and can't stand crowds.  I plan to go to a meeting but that only lasts an hour...How do you get through a lonely milestone birthday sober while grieving?  I don't know what to do but I know I can't drink...tl;dr - I'm depressed and lonely and need to get through my 40th birthday on Saturday with no real plans very little company and very few enjoyable sober activity options to pull from...,1,8suflz,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8suflz/sober_miletone_birthday_ideas/,3,2018-06-21T14:46:12
scecil9310,I'm ready to give up,(24 F)I've been sober for a year (I was forced into rehab last June) and I'm still not past any of it. I'm always ready to have a drink. I can't tell anyone the truth. My parents put a breathalyzer in my car after I left rehab just for reinforcement. I would have relapsed by now if it wasn't for that. Every time I think about how angry I am about not being able to drink I start to have a panic attack. I've tried 5 antidepressants I've been taking naltrexone since I left.... my mood swings just never stop. I want to stop being angry at my family for drinking around me but shaming me for my problem. I want to stop freaking out every time I think about wanting a drink. This is the first time I've gone out to eat since I was admitted and I'm crying in my car. I'm meeting someone I became friends with thru IOP and I don't even want to go inside. I wasn't even half way to the restaurant before I started to break down. I don't want to even see anyone enjoying themselves because I'm just that fucking miserable. Anyways I just really needed to vent. ,1,8smzn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8smzn6/im_ready_to_give_up/,22,2018-06-20T19:20:42
noremedy4memory,Hey guys I'm ____ I'm an alcoholic,I'm feeling incredibly lonely. Was angry today. I'm even Hungry and tired. I know that's a part of my problem. The HALT thing but I'm still incredibly lonely and realizing I have no real friends today. I have friends but no true connections like I used to feel. It was like this when I used having issues with connections but even then I had a couple people I felt real things for. Now I'm questioning if the one person I have those feelings for again can even be real do I even know them well enough. Do I just trick myself into having feelings of affection. Are they false out of my need to have someone. Also My  best friend  as she calls me was relapsed half the time we got to know eachother had hid it. Which I accept but I realized I don't really know her. Thoughts just rolling around my brain that lead me to I am really alone. I have an amazing sponser we have a friendship. But it's not I'm not okay with myself. I've gotten so much better but I still have my guard up tremendously with everyone and want everyone to think I'm okay and I have it. I can't come to people with my real problems I can't even speak them really. I'm 6 months in about to be on step 12 wondering if I'm a fraud who didn't really give all I should've. I've given so much but I'm still a lonely fear driven girl who feels like a stranger. I have love for others. They have love for me. They say really nice things that I feel undeserving of yet I have some semblance of self esteem today and I know I am a good person. I had a spiritual awakening before and somewhere I've fallen off track and I have been beating myself up for not taking action not showing gratitude not being social and reaching out. I don't know how to reach out when my walls are built so high. I don't really have anyone to speak to on my level. The person I wish to discuss this with probably doesn't even care. They probably just like that I admire them and give them attention. Because at the end of it all I still feel very unlovable and tonight I'm feeling like a fraud. I'm incredibly lonely. Thanks if you read this thank you for your time. I know I can come back if I take the right actions. There is nothing a drink can make better but today I've been thinking about it. For the first time in a couple months. I didn't open up even when prodded earlier it's like there's a part of my brain that goes blank around others and when confronted. I can't think. ,1,8rwxgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8rwxgx/hey_guys_im_im_an_alcoholic/,4,2018-06-18T01:01:24

moimoomoo,AA and Aspergers...I have questions,Hi. .. .1.) I have mild aspergers. Social interaction is confusing and difficult for me (and others like me) and I get scared in new situations and environments until I learn how to navigate them. ..2) I'm new to sobriety (36 days CS) and found a sponsor this Wednesday. We will start working the steps next Wednesday. I haven't told her that I'm on the spectrum and I'm just realizing that I may need to let her know this I don't know if she knows anything about ASD...Every time I've tried sobriety in the past the I was unsuccessful because meetings scared the shit out of me because the last thing I ever want to do was introduce myself to a room of strangers and I didn't know what to expect. ..This time I did my first 32 days by talking to my doctor about it a lot and taking Antabuse to help at the start. I worked with myself on just being honest about being an alcoholic going to meetings when I could and introducing myself each time I went learning the script and experimenting with sharing a little each time I went...I have been able to get through the meeting parts of A.A. as I've learned the script and am much better on that endeven though some of my sharing may have been awkward but I count that as a miracle! :)..I have no friendships outside of my family kids and partner. By nature as a person with I'm a pretty isolated person and mostly enjoy being alone to focus on the things I'm into and as an alcoholic I'm sometimes I'm into getting drunk. :)  I can't really do much to change being an aspie but I truly believe that I can continue to stay sober at A.A. I just need a primer on the social interaction/etiquette part. ...Now that I've got a sponsor and am supposed to work the steps and be part of a fellowship I'm freaking out a lot...If anyone has any questions about Asperger's or autism in general please feel free to ask! :)..Before I list my questions I want to express that I am not being negative I just don't understand...These are my main questions/areas I'm having trouble understanding/there doesn't seem to be a script:. .* My sponsor wants me to call her every day. I understand that we will work on the steps together on Wednesday but when I call her for the next 4 mornings does she also want to make small talk or does she just want to make sure I didn't drink and move on with her day? ..* When people text me or call me are they texting me because they want to talk to me and get to know me or just make sure I'm not drinking? ..As a person with Asperger's (and maybe for everyone else too?) trying to navigate new social situations can be very emotionally draining until I learn them and normally I will give myself small breaks with new things like this but AA doesn't afford that and I'm completely fixated on this right now and need to put my mind at ease...I talked to my partner about it today and mentioned that I want to stop going. He said if I want to stop going that's up to me and he'll support me in that decision but that he won't support me if I start drinking again and asked if I thought I will relapse again without AA and of course right now the answer is yes. ..vent: I'm exhausted from talking to strangers scared of actually opening up to my new sponsor and letting her know me and I really just want to go back into my hole. .Are there any other aspies trying to do AA? I need to talk to someone who understands how hard it is to work this program when just picking up the phone is scary.,1,8roq1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8roq1e/aa_and_aspergersi_have_questions/,0,2018-06-17T00:19:09

MissKayNYC,Thursday Morning's Living Sober Meeting,This always seems to happen which is why this is my favorite literature meeting..I had a serious relapse last week I went 4 days in my cave of isolation and loneliness.  These are the main reasons I drink I isolate and drink.  I spoke to no one and did not leave my apartment. Sunday night I snapped out of it (also I was freaked out because I was vomiting water for 24 hours) and made an appointment with my therapist (who I blew off Friday morning).  I saw him yesterday and we got into this and my patterns...This morning our guest chose Ch 14 "Fending Off Loneliness". As usual perfect timing and I actually spoke and explained what just happened and it's a pattern and I was glad to be in my home group discussing it with them.  I am in such a good mood and I am looking forward to tonight's 3 speaker meeting that is ALWAYS good.,1,8r3n6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8r3n6s/thursday_mornings_living_sober_meeting/,4,2018-06-14T13:18:47
BIORIO,clients in meetings,I work in a field where I come in contact with a lot of drug addicts and alcoholics. Recently a client  I work close with (who is coming back from a relapse) has been going to meetings at my home group. We haven't run into each other yet and he knows i'm in AA (he recoginzed me at my job from the rooms). My employer also knows I'm in the rooms...I feel like I should give up my home group and go elsewhere for meetings. My job isn't requiring me to do this I just don't feel comfortable sharing with clients around.

jmj55372,Sponsor question,I started the program about 65 days ago after relapsing after 6 months of sobriety. I dove into the program and surrendered any worries I had needing something to click and stay sober. I got a sponsor and started working the steps attended the meeting weekly and meeting with her weekly as well to do our step work. I had a relapse and I told her before I told my husband because I was scared. She urged me to be honest so I did also told her how much I was drinking and she advised me to go to detox. She picked me up (this is all very foggy) brought me to a hospital where I was transported to a detox facility and put on the states mandatory 48 hr hold. It was scary as hell but I felt I needed to do what I did. Once I got out I text her thanking her for helping etc etc. I haven't heard anything back in a week. I think she is avoiding me or doesn't want to work with me anymore. My question is are there any sponsors that quit working with the sponsees if they relapse? Is that the rules? I'm totally new to this AA thing and feeling confused. I'm now feeling uncomfortable to return to the meeting because of this.

YogiCCD,Herniated Disk and Medication Help?,So I've been out of work with some back pain for a few weeks. After physical therapy wasn't helping an MRI showed a herniated disk is pushing on some nerves. My doctor knows that I'm an alcoholic so we've been careful with medication. Now I need to see a neurologist and I'm worried about some prescriptions that might be offered could lead me to a relapse. I'm avoiding pain killers so far but I'm worried the discomfort I'm dealing with every day might eventually make me take something stronger than Aleve. Anyone here been in a similar situation? And for further background I'm an alcoholic but drugs are also part of my story and I'm at 9 months sober so this is new and sketchy ground. ,1,8oq2wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8oq2wg/herniated_disk_and_medication_help/,9,2018-06-05T07:36:29
WeMustReviseOurPlan,I'm mid-relapse right now and I've typed this to help you not be like me,Things to NOT do if you don't wanna relapse..1) stop calling / visiting supportive and sober people..2) give up on mindfulness only thinking about your bad past and giving up on the future..3) believe all those terrible names you've been called in the past..4) stop exercising even walking as often..5) eat a lot of carbs and sugar (sweet tooth is linked with alcoholism I don't know if anyone else has this but my relapses definitely start with lots carbs/sweet food for a few weeks) ..6) believe you are worthless even though those around you tell you otherwise ..7) forget your goals hopes and dreams..8) forget all the wonderful support you have..9) forget how hard you have worked and how amazing you are ..10) forget that you have had difficult life in one way or another... And that you are sensitive and deserve respect from others and from yourself ..This might be cheesy as f and probably wrong for many people but yeah I guess that's me right now. Be better than me.

justwonderingboutit,Asking for Advice to Support - not sure if this is the right place but any thoughts are appreciated.,Hoping for some advice from different perspectives here...I am dating an alcoholic - that is working on recovery but I don't always know best ways to support the journey to recovery...In all honesty - the majority of our relationship has been sober with a few bumps along the way. We've been dating for about 6 months and after starting to date - sobriety was there for about 5 months - a huge accomplishment! Then a few times in the last month there have been relapses...The challenges for me have been that even though the majority of what we have experienced together has been sobriety - there have been a lot of challenges along the way that at least in part relate to the alcoholism. Low self esteem/confidence depression self doubt lack of trust etc...It has been tough for me because I don't really know how to deal with a lot of these things. I have been told a lot that I don't care/love/want to be with this person - despite evidence to the contrary. This can become very defeating - and maybe at some point becomes a bit of self fulfilling as it's tough to be with someone who doesn't accept the fact that you do indeed want to be with them...I also don't know what to do and/or how to help when relapses occur. I want to be supportive - but also want to not enable self destructive behavior. What do I do to accept the person and not the behavior...Thoughts are appreciated.,1,8o9nq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8o9nq0/asking_for_advice_to_support_not_sure_if_this_is/,11,2018-06-03T12:24:34
TheNewOneIsWorse,Thoughts on a relapse,Hi guys my name is Joe and I'm an alcoholic. ..I've gone six months without drinking after years of drinking heavily every day. I'm 30. ..In early January I quit drinking with the help of a rehab program. Since leaving rehab I've felt almost no desire to drink despite almost all the worst things that can happen in a person's life...I got heavily into lifting weights and genuinely enjoyed it. I lost 40 lbs built muscle and look pretty damn sexy if I say so myself. ..I mended relationships started a new career path and I'm doing well at both. ..On Monday night I decided to drink. It felt very random. I had lost the fear of drinking and I think it had been in my subconscious for a few days. So I got a bottle. ..Anyway I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would but it was fine. And then I puked in my sleep. The cumulative hangover has knocked me totally off my axis. I've drunk each night since then and I can't believe the difference in how I feel. Physically I have no energy and my mood has been in the gutter. ..I'm stopping the cycle early this time because it's been driven home to me once again that the minor high isn't worth the major physical and mental depression that follows. ..I hope you guys don't mind if I post a victory lap update when I don't drink tomorrow night...,1,8npk7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8npk7a/thoughts_on_a_relapse/,17,2018-06-01T01:50:35

FrenchFryNinja,Daily Reflection May 26,TURNING NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE..Our spiritual and emotional growth in A.A. does not depend so deeply upon success as it does upon our failures and setbacks. If you will bear this in mind I think that your slip will have the effect of kicking you upstairs instead of down..  AS BILL SEES IT p. 184..In keeping with the pain and adversity which our founders encountered and overcame in establishing A.A. Bill W. sent us a clear message: a relapse can provide a positive experience toward abstinence and a lifetime of recovery. A relapse brings truth to what we hear repeatedly in meetings   "Don't take that first drink!" It reinforces the belief in the progressive nature of the disease and it drives home the need for and beauty of humility in our spiritual program. Simple truths come in complicated ways to me when I become ego driven...,1,8ma3ir,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8ma3ir/daily_reflection_may_26/,1,2018-05-26T09:19:40
garbage_person_,Trying to get over meeting anxiety,Over the summer I found a great young people's group that met twice a week. It helped me to achieve a month sober longer than I've had in years...Then I moved. Since moving I haven't gone to a single meeting and I've been struggling on my own. I've had several small relapses and I've decided I need to start going back...But there's the problem. There's no big AA community here like I used to have. Meetings seem somewhat scarce and from what I've heard around town a lot of the meetings posted online are inactive or don't meet...I found a meeting I'm trying to convince myself to go to but I'm nervous about going. It's a ways away from me so I don't want to drive all the way there only to find that they aren't meeting or worse that I don't fit with the group and I'm back to square one...I know it's dumb but I very much feel like the new kid at school.

rageface11,Almost 18 months and I'm not sure I'm an alcoholic,I quit drinking after I got a DUI on the way home from a date in January of 2017. I'd had 3 beers blew a .04 and spent the night in jail. On my lawyer's advice I went to treatment for 90 days and when I got out I learned that the DA's office had decided not to prosecute me. 17 months later I'm still sober and mostly happy. I've learned a ton about myself my friends/family and my higher power. Overall I'm pretty grateful for the time I've spent in the program. The problem is I'm still not sure if I ever actually belonged in the program despite the fact that I've met some great people and can actually relate to a few of them. I've been pretty unmanageable my whole life \(even before I started drinking\) and there was a time when it was the only tool I had to deal with the shit that was happening in my life but I've never actually felt powerless over alcohol. I honestly can't tell if I'm an alcoholic or if I just enjoy meetings...I know that nobody can tell me if I'm an alcoholic or not and I'm not looking for someone to take my inventory for me or anything. I just need some perspective because I really don't know who I can talk to about this. My friends \(and even ex\-girlfriends\) outside the program say they never noticed a problem to begin with. My family is worried I'll get into trouble again. People in the rooms tell me that "nobody is here by accident." My therapist says I'm just trying to justify a relapse. It just feels like everyone is either too close or too far from the situation to talk straight with me so I figured strangers might be the best bet. On one hand I feel like I've gained so much from my AA experience but on the other I don't know if I belong here or not.,1,8li1fh,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8li1fh/almost_18_months_and_im_not_sure_im_an_alcoholic/,26,2018-05-23T05:35:31

Pecansrme,I'm about to be a grandma,And my son is actively using I'm not sure what.  He's been calling texting and posting on fb all kinds of nasty things about me. His gf says he beats her but then she goes back to him and won't talk to me. I've been told I won't be allowed to see the baby. This is the closest I've been to drinking in 9 months. I don't want to drink. I just don't want to feel this way. For mother's day I got a 'fuck you bitch '. I'm heartbroken.  This is a child that was so adored and loved. He was outgoing extremely intelligent funny and good looking.  I would die for him. He has threatened to murder his own brother he's threatened things I can't repeat  he called my 70 year old mom and threatened to have her thrown in jail he threatened to tell my landlord stories to  try to get me kicked out.   If allowing him to abuse me is the requirement to see my granddaughter I won't/ can't do it. .. My sponsor's response is always to just cut him off.  But my sponsor doesn't have a relationship with her son and I'm watching her drop her sponsees as soon they get their children back from state custody.  (Most of the people in my home group are young mothers trying to get their kids back and none of them are alcoholics. They're addicts but NA in this town is a joke it's a good place to find drugs) It's like she likes it when other people don't  have relationships with their kids either. There's literally only two other women who sponsor in this small town and one of them is family. I've tried to reach out to ladies in neighboring towns and I don't get any responses.  I'm floundering dangerously. This sorry little town only has two meetings a day at noon and 6pm plus the two meetings a week at my home group.  I'm usually only able to make it to my home group. I've considered joining a different home group and chairing some 8pm meetings but aren't I supposed to be in the same home group  as my sponsor? And anyway the 8pm meeting is the group that my sponsor left (because the men in that group sent a representative to the business meeting to cuss her out and yell at her because she's a bossy gossip which is true but they couldn't have been more inappropriate in the way they went about it) to start her own group they've diminished so much that they've cancelled nearly all their meetings. It's such a big drama all the way around.  I realize this should maybe be posted in alanon but because I'm an alcoholic and my first threat is relapse I felt that it belonged here. .,1,8k8b6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8k8b6p/im_about_to_be_a_grandma/,0,2018-05-17T18:23:03
eddieweirdo,Two months ago I had one month now I slip every few days,Around mid February I went to my first meeting and stayed sober just around thirty days... I relapsed during sxsw I was working sound at an event and ran into a friend and mentor. Before I knew it I was in a group of people about to do shots it was easier to take the drink then to stop and to explain to an entire group of people why I could not. There were a lot of things I could have done instead but I took the shoot and told myself it wouldn't happen again. ..Since the end of March I've been on a weekly relapse cycle. I'm doing better then I did before a meeting but I want and need to get back to thirty days and keep pushing on. The worst part is since then I've also entered into a pretty nasty fast food habit and gained considerable weight in such a short time. I can't seem to catch myself long enough to stop slipping. ..Anyway I have more to say but have to get back to work. I plan on going to a meeting tomorrow after my shift. If anyone has advice on choosing a good sponsor that would be lovely ..,1,8j21u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8j21u5/two_months_ago_i_had_one_month_now_i_slip_every/,8,2018-05-13T02:18:55

ChappoBoppo,Rehab...again? Worth it? Feeling hopeless.,This would be my second-go at rehab for drinking (vodka almost a fifth a day). Well technically the third attempt; I relapsed immediately after my first time and then AMA'd the second time due to my anxiety.  (May and June 2017). Been silently and slowly suffering since. I never took it seriously. But now I am realizing I need true help. I am 26 years old. I feel like there is truly NO helping me. I'm a mess. I seemingly have it together but inside I do not. I can go to all of the AA meetings and therapy appointments in the world; I have. Whats going to stop me from drinking before or after them? Clearly nothing. Because this is my life now. ..I do not have any legal issues or anything against me. I do not have children. The decision to possibly go inpatient is purely voluntary. Should I go to the same facility? What's mostly stopping me is I was in rehab the same time last year and missed a family wedding. I would literally be missing another wedding along with Father's Day and my dad's birthday if I go next week. My mom seems to elude that I can't keep  missing family events  but even my doctor said what's the point of going on if I'm 30% there? I am terrified of helping myself and then coming out with NO ONE left. Truly scared. ..I saw a psychiatrist (for the first time) today; she said I have a lot of underlying mental  things going on  but can't help them until I help myself for alcoholism. .My grandfather uncle and other relatives have died from this disease. Runs rampant in my family. I work for my father so I've been able to get away with a lot. I feel like such a loser. ..I have damn near depleted my savings account due to my alcoholism. I don't even go out. I'm one of those shut-ins. I used to have everything going for me. Graduated college early bought a nice home at age 23 had thousands saved up I own my car have pets married but I feel everything is a facade. Nothing makes me happy. I find myself crying in parking lots almost hoping someone will pull me over or talk to me.

hardestmonkey2kill,How does anyone realistically afford treatment??,Hey everyone! I have posted here before and on r/addiction and I've pretty much just complained/vented about my frustrations of being an addict. I just had my most recent relapse and it seriously felt like my world was coming to an end. The psychological withdrawals were taking it's toll on me \(negative self\-talk suicidal ideations etc.\)...Well I am genuinely sick and tired of repeating the same mistakes and I want to seek help \(I am already in therapy but feel like I need something more intensive.\) I recently inquired at a treatment center called New Directions for Women that seems phenomenal. The intake manager suggested I do 30 residential/detox and then continue with intensive outpatient treatment afterwards for maintenance. Well residential detox in itself is $19000 and 1 month of outpatient treatment is $4000. Even with insurance coverage I don't know how anyone affords this!..I am your average middle class person and I definitely cannot afford this. It's no wonder so many people don't get sober!

gerbils_everywhere,43 days sober and struggling,Hello all this is my first post here. As the title says I am 43 days sober today after 6 years of problem drinking (2 of which I was alcohol dependent). I started going to AA meetings 6 weeks ago but I am really struggling to stay sober today - it seems to be getting harder not easier as I naively thought..I began drinking to help escape difficult emotions and have been offered therapy to start soon which I am hopeful about although have been in and out of therapy for the last 12 years. I am worried that a relapse will decrease the efficacy of therapy and worried I won't be able to stop again but right now I am simply not coping with my emotions at all..Sorry for the rambling my head is all over the place. Any thoughts very much appreciated.,1,8hweo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8hweo5/43_days_sober_and_struggling/,17,2018-05-08T08:48:02
biblicalunicorn,Frustrated with non-alcoholic partner,I'm now in my third year of sobriety. I met my current partner when I was in relapse and was that way for about six months. He was the primary voice that pointed out I had a drinking problem and needed help. I realized this was the truth and I sought sobriety. ..I had attempts before but never anything like this. For the first time in my life I got a sponsor that I stuck with and I worked all my steps. I moved in later to a sponsor with 39 years of sobriety and I am working my steps again. And my life began to radically change. ..I know you all know what I mean... I had lost complete custody of my two young children and I now have 50/50 joint custody with my ex-husband. I once hated my ex-husband and now we have a supportive friendship in raising our girls. I went from a dump of an apartment in a bad area to now having a three bedroom apartment in a decent area. I am finishing my master's degree in education to become a teacher. I have relationships with my family again. My parents tell me I am at the best place I've ever been in my life that they feel like they have their sweet girl back that I once was before the drinking and using. I work with others I have a Homegroup where I was once isolated and resentful I am now a friend a sister a mother. I belong to a church and have a thriving relationship with the God of my understanding. I even embrace the concept of sexual abstinence before marriage as the right path for me. I have changed my entire life and continue to strive for more change. ...But I am not perfect. I have not graduated from AA. I am still recovering in layers. It has recently come to light in my relationship that a defect of mine to sometimes launch into explosive rages and say terrible things has to be addressed. I am willing to accept responsibility for this defect to seek outside help for it in therapy and have made an appointment with a therapist that I'll be paying a hefty amount out of pocket for as I'm currently uninsured. When I see that I am wrong I promptly admit it and I seek to take prayerful action to resolve it. This is the best I can do and I try to do my best. ..My partner a long time ago tried about three al-anon meetings and decided he didn't want to work the program. He has gone to celebrate recovery a handful of times. So this has left me feeling for a long time like we are missing out on the benefits of working a tandem program together and growing together in recovery. I feel like I am doing all the work I need to do on my program and he has no program nor anything like real understanding of what my recovery means. ..This brings us to the issue I'm currently facing. I can behave very badly when I get angry and we have conflict. I am ashamed of this. I struggle with feeling hopeless and horrible. Instead of giving in to these feelings I chose to get into action to address the issue and to try to place my hope in that. Because I know I can't afford to entertain those negative emotions; it's like getting sucked into a black void and if I really believe I am hopeless then that desire to drink could swiftly follow. I've picked myself up admitted I'm wrong sought to address the wrong. I see it as just another layer in my recovery. I've faced everything else I've already faced so I can now face this. My experience tells me I am not hopeless. ..But it is hard right now having a partner with no program no al-anon no sponsor. On my good days when I  behaving in good ways he is sure about me wants a future with me. We were just out looking at houses together this past week. But when I have a bad day and I behave badly...he said something rude and hateful to me and after about three or four hours of being in control of my emotions as his comment went unresolved I finally blew up at him and swore at him in anger and frustration... he changes his mind. He is uncertain. He is confused and afraid. He doesn't want to spend his life with a hateful person. ..I calmly explained to him how I felt... that I was sorry for this part of me that it was my responsibility that I had taken the steps to begin to work on it...but his lack of faith in me in us his complete absence of a program or a sponsor his resistance to even being willing to participate in therapy with me to support and understand and to look at himself.... is just awful. He is demanding sympathy and compassion from me for what I've put him through and continue to put him through. And I've apologized taken responsibility and taken action...it's dangerous for me to wallow and grovel and despair in how bad I am and lament how terribly I've hurt him like he wants. I get it I do...but all I can do is move forward. ..He says he doesn't understand my recovery my issues. I'm like if you don't read the book come to class and study  you will fail the test. He claims that this anger issue has been around for a long time (and it has) and he's told me to deal with it for a long time now and it has nothing to do with my recovery from alcoholism. I've tried to explain that everything in my life is a part of my recovery from alcoholism and I've worked hard for going on three years now to clear up so much wreckage of my past that I'm just now getting to the point of being able to face and address it because I've been working my way to it through a lot of other things. ..But he doesn't understand because he won't go to al-anon and work the steps and get a sponsor. He doesn't understand because to him it's my job to recover not our job to recover together. I am doing everything every day to the best of my ability to strive for sobriety on every level. I'm not perfect but I never stop striving and being responsible. I feel that this is my part. And I don't know how to attend this pity party he is throwing for himself because getting into that despair and hopelessness that he's all about right now is dangerous for me. I have to keep moving; I cannot sink. And I don't know what to do about him. ,1,8hw7v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8hw7v5/frustrated_with_nonalcoholic_partner/,19,2018-05-08T08:17:21

TuckerWilliams,Relapse dreams,How do you deal with relapse dreams?  I hadn't had one for months but the one last night really bothered me.  I guess I'm thankful to have the reminder that isn't my life anymore.  But it has really shaken me.  I thanked God for the reminder of what can happen if I lose focus but I'm still feeling anxious. I texted my sponsor and she said  Thanks for sharing .  I texted a few other members and they said they don't have them...So what do others do to shake that feeling of anxiousness and doom?  Dive into the Big Book?  Keep a more conscious contact with God until the feeling passes?  Not give it a second thought?

puppydoggies,How do I best support my boyfriend?,My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost two years. We for sure have our issues and are working through them. We have a fairly "healthy" relationship but we both struggle with our own issues..My boyfriend has a serious drinking problem. I also struggled with alcohol and I've had to pull myself up on my own. He didn't want to take part in my recovery. ..He hasn't gotten into trouble with the law since we've been together and has seemed to get off fairly easy from past law run-ins. He has had a couple of slaps on the wrist but has a drinking problem and will admit it. He has been going to outpatient treatment for about three months now. He goes four nights per week and we go to a recovery relationships class together with his parents on the weekend. He has not been driving for seven months now because he can't be trusted to drive. He is a 27 year old who got their vehicle taken away from them by their parents. I know it's sad but they didn't know what to do. He was at a point that he would have killed someone. His drinking was/ is out of control....He came around to admitting that the drinking was out of his control. He seemed to be doing well but not necessarily applying himself. He was able to stay sober for over a month. Now he has relapsed several times within the past week. I know that this is something that he needs to do and all that I can really do is support him....I have been sober for almost a year. We are fairly active people so when we are together we do things outside and we don't make everything about the sobriety. I know that it is hard for him because he isn't spending time with friends and he is embarrassed to tell people about his sobriety. I am trying to stay supportive without nagging him but I know that I can be controlling and rude at times. I'm not perfect but I try to treat him with respect....Tonight he relapsed.. again. He called me and was yelling about his parents talking about hurting himself and saying that people only care about him if he is sober. I am struggling to know what to do. I notified his parents about his words about hurting himself. I don't take that as a joke. I know that he is disappointed in himself. We are all disappointed in him...He continues to blame his brain chemicals and keeps saying that he doesn't have a choice and it's not as easy as I make it sound. I agree that the addiction is more than a choice but at some point isn't it a choice? Once you fall hard enough don't you choose which path you go down? I feel like him continuing to say that it is an addiction and brain chemicals is a way for him to pass off responsibility. I'm not arguing that he is wrong but we do end up arguing because we both see the journey differently. ..What else can I do to help him on this journey? Each person's recovery is different. What has worked for him either doesn't work for him or he isn't willing to try. I'm wondering if anyone else has some input....TL;DR- My boyfriend has a drinking problem and is going to treatment. He has relapsed again and I'm wondering if there is something more that I can be doing to help him. Does anyone have a recovery story or something that has helped them?,1,8gm53k,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8gm53k/how_do_i_best_support_my_boyfriend/,0,2018-05-02T20:06:41

LIN2058183,Changing sponsor,I really want to find a new sponsor however I'm in the middle of step 5... my sponsor and I are unable to get it done in one day because she has 4 little kids. So here's the problem: 1) she is extremely rude and a bully 2) she never goes to meetings with me and 3) when I met her up to do my 5th step we go to this coffee shop and she started yelling at me in front of the coffee guy because I didn't want to go to a CA meeting and I had told her that because I am an alcoholic and only feel comfortable in AA. I also told her that we need to get my 5th step done because this can take me out but she thinks going to a CA meeting is more important. She doesn't even have a sponsor and in my opinion doesn't know what she is doing. On top of that the family she married into are close family friends with my husbands family and I'm getting uncomfortable sharing information with her. She does have good suggestions some I take and some I'm learning how to take but honestly yelling at a sponsee is absolutely unacceptable. In fact I find that abusive. I was wondering what your opinion is and give me an idea on what I should do. I don't want to relapse because of the resent I have for her. ,2,8fnd79,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8fnd79/changing_sponsor/,9,2018-04-28T18:47:23
Imsoeffedfml5,6days in cold turkey but not by choice,So I posted in TIFU about how I failed a UA for a job my po lined me up with. I have to meet with her today at 9am. Might go to jail. After I relapsed on 420 n also blacked out n apparently partook in festivities..but I haven't drank since that day. It sucks because when asked my drug of choice no matter what deep down it's alcohol (if u consider it a drug I think so) this is the longest time I've went without a drop since being locked up (8months(2012)) other than that I've drank just about everyday since HS... what are some strategies to fight the urge..might be forced to continue to be sober once I go see her today. I kinda don't wanna go but I can't run from my problems... I lost everything a supervisor position apartment friends trust from family etc... But I still keep going back to drinking. It's like I don't feel right if I don't indulge I know I sound fuckin stupid but that's how I feel. My mom broke down and begged me to quit a million times or get help breaks my heart Everytime and you would think I'd quit for  a few days nope I just drown it out...idk what to do I just fail every time...I have a 4yr degree from University but can't get a decent job cuz of my bg.

ChicoMalo69,How long before my sleeping patterns go back to normal?,I'm a little over 2 weeks sober yay :) but the only problem I've had so far is I haven't been sleeping properly...I was falling asleep around 930-10 pm and waking up between 2-4 am. Then I'd normally just watch YouTube videos until I fall asleep which doesn't happen until like 9 am but I have to be up by 10 am to get to work on time...Ideally I'll sleep through the night until 5-6 am that way I can start exercising again but it hasn't happened that way...Recently however I haven't been sleeping at all. Last night I didn't sleep until like 6 am and had to be up at 10 am. Tonight I haven't slept at all...My drinking pattern:..Before going sober I was drinking heavily for about 2 years maybe 3 to 4 times a week. Sometimes more since I'd be drunk during the day and continue when I got home...I literally quit cold turkey. I've attempted this before but would relapse after 3 days normally. This time however after taking the best vacation I've ever had I returned home and without any effort stopped drinking. I just suddenly stopped having cravings. I still don't feel the need to drink and most likely won't anymore.

Instead of support she was incredibly critical. I understand that people who don't experience the same thing as me might not get it. .Usually I'm speaking to people in the rooms who can relate to experiences with alcohol drugs etc. ..Still it was an incredibly disheartening and frustrating situation and after a few minutes of her getting down on me I told her I had to hang up the phone because the conversation was making me feel angry. ..Any advice when it comes to how much you share with close friends and family who may not really relate? ,1,8drfl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8drfl5/trying_to_explain_my_relapse_to_my_sister/,2,2018-04-20T18:06:10
throwanonymous52,Day four after my "lightest" relapse. Worst side effects ever.,This is the worst comeback ive ever experienced. I cant sleep. I cant eat the few things that brought me joy and comfort even after some really intense relapses don't anymore. I'm entering into a dual diagnosis intensive outpatient treatment (first time in any treatment i have some undiagnosed behavioral problems as well as some diagnosed) on the 26th.  have had a fuckton of check ups in the mean time. Never felt genuine paranoia before but im starting to hear voices. I left my ID at a friends house (im pretty sure im fucking scatterbrained as shit dont carry a wallet cause i am trying to mitigate my losses when something does go missing forgot to set my parking brake the other day) knocked on the door after coming home for an hour because my phone was dead left cause i figured she was asleep. Came around the building to buy a pack of cigarettes and a security guard who was parked at an adjacent building happened to pull around as i was walking around to the seven eleven. Walked over and asked if everything was cool because i couldnt tell if he was following me or not. ..What the fuck. Obviously he wasnt but it just took me 45 minutes to convince myself of that. I'm not hearing voices but I feel like a dead man walking often. ..I ate my first meal since my detox (it was a pretty mellow detox ive honestly had worse hangovers) today. Had a good conversation with three friends (trying to bounce back from my self created isolation) even got up and sang some karaoke (safe bar bartenders know not to serve me). ..Now that im alone its four am im wide awake. For a while id just drive around the city until i got tired and then id either park and take a nap or if i was close enough come home. I cant do that now because every parked cop i see on the road i pull over and "ask for directions" just to make sure they aren't eyeballing me. ..My last relapse was one drink. After a few days sober. When it wore off i had the worst panic attack since years before i even had my first drink. We had settled on dual diagnosis outpatient the night before and i figured id have one more. .The panic attacks happen about once a day since. .The other night i took a shower and didnt dry off and didnt turn the heat on in the house and laid underneath the covers. My logic was that if it was too cold to get out of bed id stay in bed till after last call and i could make it to my meeting in the morning. It worked but jesus christ is that what this has come to?..The cravings are fading as they typically start to for me around day four. Frankly ive never actually relapsed as a result of a craving. Every first drink of every relapse has been a conscious decision that ive tricked myself into making. But i feel like this is borderline psychosis. This has never happened to me before. Its never been like this. ..Fuck today i was getting a haircut and and saw a parent of a friend i havent spoken to in years in the barber chair nearby. I said "hey joeblow dont turn your head but its me throwanon52 looking good." He kind of half waved and after his haircut didnt even acknowledge me as he left and for what ever reason that gave me such a severe panic attack i almost left without paying after the haircut. What the hell? Why would that be my reaction to something as innocuous as that. ..The dual diagnosis is probably going to include some ptsd shit. Maybe my fears about that shit coming out of the woodwork next thursday is self triggering these panic attacks. I dont really know but ive never been so distracted by anxiety and paranoia that im not even thinking about drinking..If anyone has any experience with this and could offer some insight on how to cope with this or at least some knowledge about when it will stop id appreciate it greatly,2,8dmuyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8dmuyd/day_four_after_my_lightest_relapse_worst_side/,9,2018-04-20T07:30:03

It also means that I have limited energy later in the day but that's the only time she seems to be able to call. Which ends up counter productive to the work. ...I don't like to think of quitting on someone in pain - who is turning up but I can't go on like this for much longer. It's taking up too much head space. ..There's a lot of control stuff coming up and that (to me) is the opposite of surrender. ...I've started going to al-anon meetings in addition to speaking with other members and spoken with my sponsor who thinks it might be time to let go...,1,8cs6oa,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8cs6oa/challenging_sponsee/,18,2018-04-16T19:48:09
chiefsdelaval,Surrendering, Hi Reddit I'm fairly new here and am seeking some sage advice. So a little bit about myself  ( excuse my grammar)- I have recently quit using all substances and am 95 days sober. I have been a serious poly user for about 8 years with benzos and coke being my DOC. I moved from the midwest to SoCal in January to seek help to get off the benzos for good (first time attempting to after 6 years prescribed 4mg a day) and am in sober living now after completing rehab. The entire time in rehab I have been plotting my potential relapse with beer. I've used my reason for coming to rehab (benzos) as an excuse to drink again because I don't intend on using narcotics ever again. I've voiced this desire and quickly learned to shut my mouth about it because  the affirmation  I've been seeking has been shut down immediately by the fellowshipwhich. I tell myself  "I'm not that bad of an alchy"  and "I'm an IPA conneseur" so I don't fit the mold. The evidence  of alcoholism speaks through my past though and this frame of thinking. I'm really struggling with completely surrendering and letting go of this reservation.  I know deep inside I will gain serenity through surrendering and working the steps but the thought of never drinking again is frightening.  I need to quit thinking like this and take it one day at a time.   Has anybody else on here struggled with this issue with some tips? Thanks...,1,8cpwcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8cpwcq/surrendering/,7,2018-04-16T14:41:19
FrenchFryNinja,Daily Reflection April 13,THE FALSE COMFORT OF SELF-PITY..Self-pity is one of the most unhappy and consuming defects that we know. It is a bar to all spiritual progress and can cut off all effective communication with our fellows because of its inordinate demands for attention and sympathy. It is a maudlin form of martyrdom which we can ill afford...  AS BILL SEES IT p. 238..The false comfort of self-pity screens me from reality only momentarily and then demands like a drug that I take an ever bigger dose. If I succumb to this it could lead to a relapse into drinking. What can I do? One certain antidote is to turn my attention however slightly at first toward others who are genuinely less fortunate than I preferably other alcoholics. In the same degree that I actively demonstrate my empathy with them I will lessen my own exaggerated suffering..,2,8bybzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8bybzd/daily_reflection_april_13/,3,2018-04-13T07:10:09
Thrillz559,Is this dishonest?,So I just got back in after a lengthy relapse about 4 months after being sober for a little over 3 months. All of this sobriety was during a 28 day inpatient program and in sober after living 5 hours away from where I live now I say this because I had to find all the meetings here and make new connections meet new people. My question is. I have being going through bad anxiety from the withdrawals after my long binger that abruptly quit and left to a meeting. Tonight will be my 3rd meeting in 3 days. Only my second day sober. How ever I smoked some resin from my bong this morning to help me with this anxiety and eat a meal since i haven't really ate since i stopped. When I introduce myself again today do I go back to say Im on day sober and perhaps tell them why? Or do I just not bring it up and make sure not to do it again?,1,8aj741,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8aj741/is_this_dishonest/,27,2018-04-07T12:31:52

030218,Day 31 thoughts,Hey all I'm actually a little nervous to go today and pick up my one month chip. I posted in SD last week but haven't updated however I lost a parent this week. I quit a couple of months ago and slipped 32 days ago when he was diagnosed. This morning I got a text from a friend congratulating me on 90 and it kind of killed my enthusiasm as I had to reset the clock. I know relapse happens all the time at various lengths of sobriety but man it really blows to reset the clock. I know I need to not beat myself over that and celebrate where I'm at today so I'm trying to pump myself up again before this meeting. Anyway thanks for reading and I hope everyone has a nice day. ..Edit from comment below: It ended up being a wonderful meeting. My great grand sponsor took 25 years and everyone was really proud of me. The woman who introduced me to the meeting presented a chip for me which was lovely. Thanks guys.   ,2,8921kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/8921kg/day_31_thoughts/,7,2018-04-02T13:41:08
eladaz88,As an SO how can I help?,My boyfriend had been drinking heavily for 3-4 years (2-3 half gals of liquor a week at its worst I think it was closer to 4 a week). He recently got sober and almost lasted 2 months. He relapsed last week. .He went to a couple meetings right before getting sober but he didn't like them he told me he couldn't relate because all these people had been years and years sober where he had just taken a couple shots before the meetings. Talking after his relapse we both agree its imperative he try to work out going to meetings now that he can relate a little better maybe get a sponser. I say work out because he works nights and its difficult for him to make meetings. The one he did like he would only been able to make once a week because of his work schedule..I would like to know how can I help him? Is there anything I can do as an SO? We're both going through this for the first time together him as an addict me as an SO of an addict..Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

vertin1,Still have major anxiety,Hey I am coming up on six months and I still have crazy anxiety. I grind my teeth due to anxiety and it's taking a toll on me. I have a sponsor pray everyday and on step 11. I'm gonna start trying to get sponsees soon but I still feel like I'm a mess. I'm doing everything suggested and my life is great on the outside but I'm still dying on the inside.  I feel like using a lot but I'll die if I relapse which would be terrible for my family. But I'm always in so much self pity and fear that I just want to die.

_composuree,Would it be against the program to sell weed?,Now I don't mean to be disrespectful in any way by posting this but I'm running out of options.  I joined the program six months ago had 3 months originally &amp; after a couple of relapses I hit 30 days again last week.  I have lived by the program and it is changing my life I'm a forever grateful recovering alcoholic.  .Lately I've been getting super frustrated.  I don't have my license (DUI) &amp; I can't afford the fines to get it back.  I'm 21.  It's very hard to find a job in walking distance.  I didn't even smoke weed before I started the program but I sold it.  I was wondering if I could get input on if this is considered not doing the program legitimately or how this could affect my sobriety?  I hope nobody gives a thumbs down on this I'm genuinely asking for advice.  Thank you. ,4,87fbf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/87fbf6/would_it_be_against_the_program_to_sell_weed/,14,2018-03-26T23:30:20
MrsMertonsBirdland,revisited alcohol addiction counselor same odd thing happened,so i went back to see this alcohol addiction counselor again who i drifted away from in december because she told me she couldn't see me for two weeks in a row on dec 14th. (i did relapse in the  meantimenot to blame her) and it did not seem like she was really going to lets say paris on a huge trip but rather she just needed a break from... something. anyway went to her see again last week after a few months because i've been struggling again. after the session ends she says...once again.. i am going on spring break the office will be open but i am  basically not going to be available. i realize people do take big trips however i get strange vibes and it seems like the same all over again.  like she's casually mentioning some "spring break" that affects me in that i will have no counseler. i dunno it just seems insincere how she says it. like "oops well.. sorrrry i wont be here." not hey i have this trip planned...i can't make it in but will you be ok... etc. i mean i i came to her because i am in danger of dying of alcoholism! i need a counselor! o well thanks for reading.,6,873ots,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/873ots/revisited_alcohol_addiction_counselor_same_odd/,23,2018-03-25T17:00:43
Myexisacheatingwhore,Forced to return.,So I got in trouble a year ago ( sober ) via acting on defects. I've since then relapsed and got shipped to Florida where I've lived in sober living and quite honestly flourished. For the first time I've built a great sober network of guys and was happy. I have six months of sobriety and ten days ago I received a note from my lawyer that I've got to return to Lancaster ASAP. I'm writing this on the airplane. For the first time in my life I've had real friends. I couldn't even properly say goodbye to all of them. It sucks. It's scary. I'm forced to live back home where I've never really gotten into a good groove. I could never put together a few months and honestly felt apart from the recovery community there... The good news is that I'm sober got some time some connection with a HP and some confidence. I'm still pretty bummed out that I've been thrown this curve ball but can see a silver lining as well. Anyone else go through this? Any tips or experience to give? I'm going to keep the ball rolling and try to recreate what I had down here in Florida but still am trepidatious. I love this sub and love you guys. Thanks.,6,872ox3,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/872ox3/forced_to_return/,10,2018-03-25T14:39:21
nowayjesus1,Can't shake this shit.,I'm 60 days sober. About a week ago I think i might have accidentally taken a sip of alcohol at a friend's house..Read here https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/86fk09/i_dont_know_if_i_accidentally_took_a_sip_of/..Iv done an inventory. Iv talked to tons of people..And either way I feel like I'm not being honest with myself cuz I genuinely don't know if that drink had any in it..So if I call it a relapse or if I keep my time I'm feeling werid about both. At least today I am. And I'm not gonna drink or use over it today but I don't want it to add up.,9,86u7ju,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/86u7ju/cant_shake_this_shit/,16,2018-03-24T12:43:19
nowayjesus1,I don't know if I accidentally took a sip of alcohol,I was house sitting for a friend the other night. She drinks but is not an alcoholic. I noticed the bottle of wine in the fridge and thought nothing of it. My desire to drink and use has been gone for a while..But I grabbed a half full bottle of cherry Pepsi. Took a sip and swear to god I thought I tasted whiskey in it. The panic attack was instant. I called my sponsor and 20 others freaking out. They assured me I wouldn't lose any time but I could give a fuck about that compared to the black outs and heroin needles that await a relapse. .She assured me there was no alcohol in it. So I don't know if I was just not accustomed to the cherry flavor of the Pepsi or if she was drinking from the bottle with alcohol on her lips..Can anyone relate?,5,86fk09,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/86fk09/i_dont_know_if_i_accidentally_took_a_sip_of/,20,2018-03-22T18:09:27
fluorideboyzzz,psychedelics in recovery?,hey everyone - this is an interesting topic that's been raising itself in my life lately:..I've been in the rooms since I was 16 off of pills i'm now in my early 20s recovering from iv cocaine and heroin. ..Earlier in my youth I used psychedelics occasionally but never saw the appeal - they didn't make me feel "good" or quiet the incessant noise in my head in fact frequently they made it louder - they just made me notice things more or feel "different" so i primarily abstained instead expending my resources towards opiates and stimulants and drink. ..At this point in my recovery though I've just barely dipped my toes back into psychedelics. Around a month ago I used LSD once. ...I did so with some apprehension that it would re-awaken my addiction but after surrendering myself to that possibility and reminding myself of Bill's use of LSD saying that it could invoke a spiritual experience in an addict who wasn't having one I took the plunge and I was truly amazed. ...It wasn't at all recreational. It was at some points almost unpleasant. There was anxiety. There was a deep view into my own thought processes surrounding drugs. ..I watched every aspect of a craving form I noticed how irrational that phenomenon is which is something I never do. ...A month after the experience I feel no urge to do it again. No cravings no desire to feel different. ..Nothing aside from a reduction in my depression and a subtle deadening of a little piece ego that no stepwork or 12th step or spiritual experience had any measure against. ...Some things do come to mind though - when bringing this up in meetings I'm expected to restart my clean time and treat it as a relapse. ..I'm not sure what I'm asking perhaps it's more of a discussion post but I'm just curious as to what everyone's experience with this topic have been? ..Thanks y'all!..,0,85h1dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/85h1dg/psychedelics_in_recovery/,13,2018-03-19T00:59:53
sparklyderp,After a year and 93 days of being sober my alcoholic brain is trying to take over.,So for the past year and 3 months while sober I have been using anime video games and school to give me an escape from reality. I've been replacing negative habits (alcohol) with better habits. It has worked out really well lately until this past week. For this whole time I haven't even wanted to drink at all and I could easily turn it down and not think about it. It hasn't been tempting me. I go day by day with constant fear that my little voice in the back of my head is going to take over and have me believe I can drink. It's a crazy strong urge and no one can change my mind if it gets past a certain point. I become a whole different person and nothing can convince me not to drink. I'm not there thankfully but it's how I relapsed the last couple times. I've been depressed lately (for no reason at all because nothing is going wrong in my life). I just really hate how I can be in such a good mind set for so long and then my brain switches over to "well I want to drink so I'm going to". It's very scary. I just took psychology 101 so now it's causing me to try to think deeper into things lol. But seriously why does my brain do this. So I'm tying to dig deeper and think about what has changed this past week to cause me to feel irritable depressed and basically just wanting to be fucked up. I wonder if it has anything to do with having to take Vicodin for 3 days because I've had a massive WEEK long migraine and nothing got rid of the pain. I know I can't keep pain killers around (have to keep them at my parents) because I love the feeling too much but I'm wondering if that's what is fucking with me. Thank you for letting me vent. ,2,84trli,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/84trli/after_a_year_and_93_days_of_being_sober_my/,19,2018-03-16T03:46:56
[deleted],Fianc  less than 1 month sober wants to drink at bachelor party (x-post r/stopdrinking),Sorry for the novel; looking for some advice thanks in advance. ...After a number of escalating incidents my fianc  recently decided to stop drinking at the very least until our wedding in May potentially for longer. I am completely in support of this an have also stopped drinking in solidarity and to make sure he doesn't have any temptation in the house. He is not in any type of recovery program for both personal and practical reasons but has a fairly strong support network of family and friends. ...His friends - all of whom drink but only some to a problematic level - are throwing him a surprise bachelor weekend and he wants to drink while there. ...His arguments are; .- That it's s once in a lifetime experience which is supposed to symbolize the end of  that life  and won't lead to relapse. .- Was a surprise which would be rude to turndown completely but he has already said no bars or clubs just the boys at one of their houses playing video games etc. thus would be a safe environment in which to drink since no one will be driving or going out anywhere. .- They won't be drinking in excess just splitting a case between the 5 of them. ...On one hand I understand these arguments and agree with some of them such as it being rude to turn down entirely. I don't understand fully why drinking has to be involved. I know that he has fun with these guys sober I've seen it and I'm worried it's just another excuse to start up again. He and a few of the other guys attending have major self control issues once they've had a few and I'm not convinced they wouldn't go out for more beer after drinking the first 24. ...I've already told him I support him in his sobriety but this is ultimately his choice and voiced my concerns about a relapse. Despite this he is confident it will be a one time thing specifically related to the once in a life time opportunity of a bachelor party. ...I haven't struggled with this type of addiction but from my experience with other addiction and family members with addiction plus his history of  quitting  finding some excuse ( it's the holidays! ) and seriously relapsing I have trouble believing that this really will be a one time thing. I guess that's the really long winded way of asking your advice as people who have experienced this first hand. Should I be worried or is this really a one off? How can I best make sure he doesn't miss out on the fun of a bachelor party and still support him in his sobriety? ,0,84ma4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/84ma4t/fianc _less_than_1_month_sober_wants_to_drink_at/,27,2018-03-15T09:03:09
Trax-makinem,Coming back after 7 months out,I had 10 months in the program. I had worked the steps and been  graduated  by my sponsor. I chaired two meetings a week for several months. I had problems with the  god bit  always. I've been out on a 7 month relapse which has been awful and downright dangerous. I've been apprehensive but finally screw it I'm returning to AA..Before and since I left AA I've been looking into the secular movement within AA. I hope to learn more about how atheists are thriving in the program and maintaining sobriety. I hope to find a way to find meaning progress and comfort in AA once again while remaining true to myself. .I still have a lot of reservations but I don't really care either cause I just cant handle using anymore. It's gotten to be physically and emotionally crippling. I think I'm finally willing to shut up enough to accept some help. I reaaally want this to work this time. I haven't made it to a meeting yet today I just needed to tell some addicts I'm back. .Hugs to y'all for being here thaaaanks!,6,83hdcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/83hdcr/coming_back_after_7_months_out/,15,2018-03-10T14:30:46
jcgordon550,Addiction recovery therapist suggests  planned relapse? ,__***3/10: Important Notes - It's worth mentioning that this was NOT my individual therapist but one who worked for the inpatient rehab I was in last week. It's almost 4 hours away so I don't anticipate visiting this therapist ever again if I can help it. Also at the time of posting this I HAD NO OPINION ON THE ADVICE FROM THE THERAPIST.  I am just a baby as far as recovery goes and was interested in input from all of you. Thank you for all of the amazing help so far!!***__..I made my first post today as a recovering binge drinker and this group has been AMAZING. I'm 26F and 12 days sober after a black out binge. I attempted suicide and was admitted to an inpatient treatment facility for 5 days. There I learned a lot about why my subconscious drunken mind pushed me to suicide when I was  fine  when sober. Turns out you can only numb the feelings you refuse to deal with for so long. ..Anyways I'm home now and working actively on my recovery. Staying away from drinking has been relatively easy so far and the people close to be have been extremely supportive. I'm attending intensive outpatient support and therapy groups to deal with all of the issues I refused to face for so long and I'm really optimistic about my future. ..Here's the kicker - my fianc  and I are going to New Orleans with his cousin and wife in early April. We got a hotel room right on Bourbon St. which was done with the idea of drinking and no driving. This was planned months ago and we have paid $2500 in non refundable or transferable plane tickets and hotel reservations. ..While I was inpatient I brought this up as one of my biggest concerns because I've put my fianc  through enough hell lately - I'm not making him forfeit his vacation too. The therapist offered the common advice such as discovering the history of the city versus the bars stay back and do my own thing while they go out etc. But she ultimately had some surprising advice for a seasoned addiction therapist and 30 year sober alcoholic: .. Ultimately if you know you won't be able to go and not have a drink: plan your relapse. ..Basically go into it with a game plan a start date and end date and someone you trust to keep an eye on your alcohol intake and level of inebriation. She said this will make sure you don't set yourself up for failure and feel like a piece of shit when you cave. It also apparently makes it much more unlikely that you continue the relapse after this  end date.  ..Looking for any feedback or opinions on this?,9,83ch0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/83ch0o/addiction_recovery_therapist_suggests_planned/,50,2018-03-09T22:00:07
dnbtim,Is it coman to relapse and start drinking heavier than ever before?,So I had a month of being sober at that point I relapsed once I came off the so called pink cloud. I thought I would be able to control it and make it more of a weekend thing but it progressed over a few weeks and now I'm literally drinking every single night! Before attempting sobriety I would drink about 3 to 5 nights a week and not as many drinks in one night as I am now. Ever since I started drinking again it's like alcohol became that ex-girlfriend that you lost and you missed so much and now she's back and you just can't get enough of her and you don't want to ever loose her again! Can anyone else relate to this?..So for those of you who are sponsor's or have had an amazing sponsor before please give me advice on how to really absorb the first step of admitting that I am powerless under alcohol and my life is unmanageable! What do you do with your sponsees on the first step or what have you seen in the past that has been very successful on helping people come to terms of their powerlessness under alcohol?..Thank so much for any advise given!!!,7,832ulw,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/832ulw/is_it_coman_to_relapse_and_start_drinking_heavier/,13,2018-03-08T20:17:31
OK-Potato,Serial relapses.,Well the title says it all. I've been in and around AA for coming up-to 11 years. During that time I've had months with complete abstinence and a couple of times I've hit or almost hit the year mark...I'm a binge drinker. So my relapses can be one night affairs sometimes it can be where I drink 3 or 4 times a week for a while for a period of months. ..I absolutely hate it. It feeds into a negative cycle of self loathing as inevitably I do or say stupid things that make my life worse. This in turn impacts my mental health and self esteem. ..I've had sponsors and worked through to step 10. I've done steps 4 5 and 9 and few times now (the hard ones) and I will say it had a positive effect but it hasn't stopped me drinking. ..I have a new sponsor who is very good he listens to me and actually seems to care. As a result I've opened up more than I have done with previous ones. But I'm still struggling not to binge especially if my depression is particularly bad. ..I don't want to have to keep doing this over and over and over again. Each time I "come back" it gets harder and harder to go through it all again. Just to throw it away a few days weeks months later. ..I can't even say that I'd rather be drinking I HATE the stuff. It has been the root cause of all my problems and yet I find myself doing it over and over. ..I'm just tired of it all and wanted to get it out there as I'm not a very eloquent sharer and frankly people must be sick of seeing back in and out all the time. ..Thank you for reading. ..PS.

dbarpuck,Dropping a sponsee,The way I understand the big book it tells me that if I feel someone is not ready I should find someone who is ready that is  worthwhile  ... Now I have had to cut ties with sponsees before and it is not easy but how many chances are we supposed to give? If someone just isn't listening or taking suggestions and doing the whole self-will-run-riot deal what do you guys do? Also if a sponsee relapses say after you've done the steps say maybe up to 6 or 7... or where-ever...do you start over??? I am just curious to see what you guys say. sponsorship is a crucial part of my recovery and I always keep at least two guys on i don't just give guys the boot and give up on them but sometimes I feel I need to find someone who is more  ready ... i have been sponsoring guys for a good few years and the first few years I didn't have too much success(meaning guys staying sober obviously but trust me I know its not MY success but rather the programs Gods and theirs but for strictly proof that program works i say success) but after learning more about how I wanted to sponsor guys I got better at finding guys who are more desperate and  ready  (IMO) thanks everyone!,2,80195y,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/80195y/dropping_a_sponsee/,12,2018-02-24T20:37:31

JacobjamJacob,Relapsed. Just need someone to listen.,Hey all. Hope everyone is hanging in. I'll make this short because I know you all know the story. Had about 10 months. Stopped going to meetings calling my sponsor and just really discouraged with my recovery. So my solution (cause that always gets great results) was to find a girl that was as sick as I am and try to run away from me. Well she cheated on me. All hell broke loose.  And I have been on a full on bender for four months. I cannot get any traction. Part of me wants to be sober and part of me is just like fuck it all. .I really don't want to die. I hate this fucking disease. How do I get back on track. Praying to my HP everyday. Going and sharing at meetings. I don't know what to do anymore.,10,7ypp1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7ypp1r/relapsed_just_need_someone_to_listen/,22,2018-02-19T15:11:28
Bonefiend18,Relapsed on Tuesday night,I relapsed on tuesday night. Not so bad but it still sucks. I had a DUI class Wednesday night. Everything went well and i was feeling pretty positive and good. I just got paranoid and started thinking that the instructor could see that i relapsed. I keep thinking that i am going to get kicked out of the program even though i was sober when i attended. Nothing was brought up about the subject if i was under the influence or not. I signed the attendance sheet and participated real well. Has any body else gone through this? Anybody with experience in DUI programs know if you can get booted from the program without being notified first or without being submitted to a breathalyzer?,3,7y88e3,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7y88e3/relapsed_on_tuesday_night/,10,2018-02-17T13:07:20
dnbtim,My depressive relapse!,So I'm newer to AA and I made it almost a month. Back when I used to drink on a regular basis I loved it. It felt good it was pleasurable it relaxed the nerves it brought me out of my shell  and the list goes on. The reason why I knew it was time to quit is because I was spending too much money slowly killing myself and always hungover at work and wasn't on a clear head. The month a stayed sober was pretty easy at first mostly because I was on the pink cloud. Once that slowly started to dissipate is when I foolishly though I can learn to control it and only drink in moderation. The first time I tested the waters I felt pretty depressed as I slowly consumed that first beer. Over the last two weeks I drank moderately on the weekend nights. A couple of times they just made me more depressed the other times where just so so but never was as good as it used to be. Well on Friday night I drank two beers and called it good and decided to go to bed. All I have to say is that I felt depression on a whole new level! I couldn't even fall a sleep because my body was physically antsy and the depression was out of this world! It's like my body physically wanted more but I was in such a dark depressive state I was concerned about my well being! Finally I drank some detox tea until I finally fell asleep...1. Is it common for a relapse to put you in a dark depressive state like it did for me instead of being like old times?..2. I think this means I'm having a hard time admitting to myself the powerless when it comes to alcohol. If anyone has any good advice on the first step can you please share?..Thank you!,4,7tkr4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7tkr4b/my_depressive_relapse/,6,2018-01-28T10:14:16
bofo2,Hopefully going to look back on 1/15/18 as my long-term sober date.,My name's Bo I'm an alcoholic...Hello r/AA..I've been in and out of the program. I have "sober" dates in July October December and most recently just short of 2 weeks ago. I have a sponsor and a home group who have welcomed me back after a couple of months of relapse and absence...I realized I have the disease of Alcoholism truly this morning. I drank a whole pot of coffee out of compulsion and got sick. Sure the last time I drank 2 Sundays ago I had only 2 drinks but i was compelled to have twice as much as I planned just as I was compelled to use caffeine to alter my state of mind this morning. ..Thank you r/AA I hope to check in here more and on other subs. Grateful to be here.,4,7tewr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7tewr7/hopefully_going_to_look_back_on_11518_as_my/,4,2018-01-27T14:23:50
PM_me_your_Jeep,My sponsor called me to tell me he'd been drinking the last couple months.,So my sponsor and I ended up being pretty good friends after we completed the steps. The last few months we've both been busy. I haven't been going to many meetings but always keep in touch with my sober circle. He stopped going to meetings completely and our communication dropped off quite a bit. But we still texted and talked shit. ..He called me today and we bullshitted a little then he let me know he's been drinking. He struggled with  dry goods  as well and says he's not on those. Says he's drinking responsibly having a good time not missing work or driving drunk.... ..Part of me doesn't care. He's a grown up and can do what he wants. The other part of me feels a little abandoned. He's my dude. Someone I confided in about some crazy shit and who helped guide me through my process. ..I've seen many people relapse in my 19+ months but most of them didn't put in the work or didn't have a role in my sobriety. So I kind of shrugged it off. This one feels different. A few of us had an idea he was drinking again but hearing it from the source is weird. It is causing some thoughts and emotions I didn't see coming. I'm mad then I don't care then I'm like fuck it hat's off to you man! But part of me is also jealous. Like damn he can (so far) drink without impunity so maybe I can. It's a weird spot to be in. ..Have any of you dealt with this? I'm conflicted about talking to any of my sober friends as they are all mutual friends of his and I don't want to put his shit out there. ,3,7srzr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7srzr6/my_sponsor_called_me_to_tell_me_hed_been_drinking/,17,2018-01-24T19:45:12

TuckerWilliams,Maybe I can get some insight about sponsor,My sponsor has been telling me lately that my choices are bad and that I will relapse if I keep making bad choices.  I'm not sure how to handle it.  She basically is telling me that I have no business going to places that focus on alcohol sales.  I have never felt triggered or tempted in the least.  It seriously doesn't even enter my mind because the people I'm with are very casual drinkers they aren't getting loaded like I used to do.  ..-friend who moved away a year ago was in town for one night over the holidays. A group were meeting with her at a tapas place. I had iced tea/food and it was fine. Sponsor told me to call her before during and after the hour dinner...-childhood friend was in town with some of her friends. They invited me to join them at dinner at a brewpub. We had dinner and they each had one beer I had water. Totally fine but sponsor told me it was a mistake to go...-spouse had company holiday party and it was at a brewpub.  Sponsor told me I had no business going and I was setting myself up to relapse.  It was an open bar so I had 6 seltzers and seriously never even thought about the fact that I was the only person there not drinking.  Not one person was noticeably intoxicated very casual drinking...I'm 7 months sober never have had a relapse and I feel like I'm doing well.  I understand people can relapse once they become comfortable and possibly complacent in their sobriety but in the chapter of the Big Book  Working with Others  it talks about how you couldn't and shouldn't try to completely shield an alcoholic from alcohol and if such steps are necessary they still have an alcoholic mind.  I understand not going to a bar with people who are there to get drunk but isolating myself from all social situations seems like a bad idea too...I guess I'm looking for guidance.  Is my sponsor correct and I should avoid situations like this completely from now on?  Is she being overbearing and rigid in her opinions?  Please share your thoughts.,3,7qofxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7qofxp/maybe_i_can_get_some_insight_about_sponsor/,16,2018-01-15T19:34:57
perfectlymessedup,story,i guess i've had my last drink on wednesday night thursday morning i paid my bar tab thursday night i got off the train to visit my brother. after eating with him at a restaurant i began to experience sever anxiety and paranoia. i can't tell him i relapsed too ashamed and don't want the lectures. i had to hang out with him for about 7 hours and it was hard when i just wanted to be home drinking water. so i got home and ate some noodles laid down and just started feeling like death. i closed my eyes to see faces and scary eyes looking at me. i can't hardly explain it. i am sorry i am just rambling here to make things make sense to myself. today around noon i finally felt like i wasn't insane. but for a while there i was in a very bad mental state. thank  you,1,7q0lat,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7q0lat/story/,11,2018-01-12T18:15:33

Caligirl1986,I'm having a hard time and need some advice. Somebody please help.,So just past 30 days sober and I am in this thing now. I've dedicated my whole life to staying sober. When I originally started this my sister in law had just recently become sober as well so we were a big support for each other. Hearing her happiness gave me the nudge I needed to do what I already knew I wanted but struggled with. ..After a couple of weeks she relapsed. When she does this she disappears for days at a time which is very hard for me because we are super close. This past relapse I didn't hear from her for 5 days. I finally talked to her today and she told me everything she had experienced and how she doesn't want to do this anymore and is struggling. ..After this past relapse I want to help her in any way I can to stay sober knowing that it's ultimately up to her. I need advice on what to say to her when she disappears for days as well as what to do when she calls and is struggling and wants to drink but is calling so she doesn't do it. what do I say??,3,7p1roa,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7p1roa/im_having_a_hard_time_and_need_some_advice/,14,2018-01-08T16:13:13
anchor139,I'm at a loss,Need advice. As the S/O of someone who struggles with drinking I'm interested to hear from others how they want to be supported. What's the best way to go about this? What would be most beneficial to you? A little backstory: my s/o went about 9 months without had a pretty hefty relapse this past summer and has struggled every couple months since. I'm trying to be supportive but I become a monster when they drink. I'm at my wits end. I just found out they've been drinking again tonight and I'm so frustrated because this really could have been avoided. Its just a couple beers so far so they're a saying it won't be an issue. Until tonight It's been about a week since the last drink. My immediate reaction is to get upset and I tend to lecture. Which I hate. So what should I do? Part of me thinks I should go home (we don't live together) and calm myself down. But then I get these crazy thoughts like...what if they do something stupid and hurt themselves or someone else? What if me leaving them alone tonight makes them so depressed it gets worse? I feel trapped and like there's no good way to respond to this without either feeling like I'm abandoning them or without confronting and making them feel even worse about themselves. So if you were the one sitting at home after a couple beers right now how would you want your s/o to respond? What would help you out the most?? .Thanks ,3,7ogitg,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7ogitg/im_at_a_loss/,21,2018-01-05T21:51:19
SilllyGirl,Having trouble getting willingness for a new sponsor,So I moved cross country almost two years ago. I had about a year sobriety at that point and a fantastic sponsor. I started attending meetings in my new city. There is a great recovery community here. I did go several months without going to meetings and relapsed last year. I'm clean again and go to meetings regularly but I know my sobriety is not sustainable unless I get a sponsor and go through the steps again. Any time I get the courage to talk to a woman after a meeting the meeting disperses and everyone goes home before I get a chance and then my courage goes away. I'm definitely ready to get a sponsor and do this thing. I want to be truly sober and not just clean. I miss the serenity and I want to start giving back also. I guess I just need a little encouragement. ..Edit: .Upon re-reading this post I know it sounds like a bunch of excuses. I just need to get over my social anxiety I suppose. ,0,7o1rwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7o1rwx/having_trouble_getting_willingness_for_a_new/,4,2018-01-04T03:53:51
_troubled_,My parents met in AA and are now heading towards divorce,My parents met in AA close to 30 years ago and sobriety/abstinence was a part of their wedding vows. I don't know their complete history with relapse and whatnot but I do know they both have relapsed in the past...My mother is still heavily against drinking. So much so that it's quite uncomfortable to have a drink around her. ..Anyway long story short my dad's consumption is out of control but not to him of course. Any time my mother confronts him about it he thinks it's a joke and is in classic denial. He tries twisting the blame on her which is something I'm sure is all too familiar to some of you. My dad was a quiet guy my entire life and he still is when he's sober. When he drinks he has no filter and cusses like a sailor. It's just disgusting. ..It makes me angry seeing my mother upset and him obviously being the source of it all. I could unleash on him but I feel like that isn't the answer. At this rate nothing is going to change without a huge wake up call whether it's something medical or a divorce. He obviously doesn't think my mom is going to do anything...Is there anything I can even do? This is something that's been a problem before my time. My relationship with my dad has never been great. We're both quiet and hide our emotions...Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ,1,7mjyni,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7mjyni/my_parents_met_in_aa_and_are_now_heading_towards/,4,2017-12-27T22:14:14

RaiderN8tion,I relapsed after 2 weeks without drinking and hit a new rock bottom,I have been trying to stop drinking for a while now. But can't seem to ever make it I've gone to meetings and tried to work the steps by myself only to go back to drinking. I havnt had to courage to try and get a sponser. I work at a restaurant where we are allowed to drink and everyone takes shots of Jameson before during and after work. I fell in the trap and went on a 2 day bender only to remember I was doing coke with my boss and coworkers. I quit that job today. I did some terrible things and said some horrible things to my wife. And I can't forgive myself it's tearing me apart. I have a family history of alcoholism and I know I'm not gonna live much longer if I stay down this path. I'm going to fly to Colorado on Thursday to meet with my cousin who has been sober for 13 years thanks to AA. So hopefully she can help. Any advice on how to forgive myself or what I need to do would be greatly appreciated.

ginnyjean,Relapsed and too guilty admit it to anyone.,Hi everyone long-time lurker/ first time poster here. I made an account just to get this out to confide in people who understand..I'd been sober (this time) for ten months. The day after I hit ten months I bought a drink and from there the floodgates opened. AA saved my life but after a while the guilt consumed everything. Even working the steps I felt I wasn't "good enough" that I didn't deserve these people so willing to be there for me. I can't seem to move away from my alcoholic past i feel like I don't deserve to live a happy sober life due to all the pain I've caused to others. I now have 7 trashbags full of alcohol hidden in my basement since I relapsed last week. Every time I toss a bottle and the pile adds up I watch it grow and I can see the repercussions coming from a mile away. I'm too ashamed to admit my relapse to anyone and start over and I'm too ashamed to continue this life of secrecy and guilt. I feel as if I'm stuck like this is just the life I was made living for...TLDR; how did you surpass the guilt when admitting to a relapse and starting over yet again?,10,7hlzeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7hlzeh/relapsed_and_too_guilty_admit_it_to_anyone/,16,2017-12-04T19:54:03
nickisarealperson,Seeking some advice on my sober living house,I'm at a strange mental place with my living situation. Less than two months into sobriety I feel like some of the safety barriers I've set up are gratuitous...The house I selected when getting out of rehab has A LOT of rules. 10 pm curfew limited movement in terms of places I'm allowed to go.. I can't take a job that doesn't allow me to go to the daily hour long meeting or that keeps me out past 10...I feel like I absolutely needed it straight out of rehab but a month in I already feel like it's holding me back. I was making so much spiritual and mental progress that has now essentially stopped. Part of it is simply feeling like I don't need to be here...Another issue are the attitudes of the men I'm now constantly surrounded by. Older men generally who are extremely bitter and lack the ability to trust anyone. I'm working hard at recovery and at work yet I'm singled out to be grilled constantly accused of lying and peppered with questions about where I'm going and what I'm doing. I should never have brought women over as that created an additional level of jealousy. This has had an extremely negative affect on my general attitude and willingness to engage with any of them...I know that this place may be the only reason I've yet to relapse. But I also know that I don't HAVE to be there. I'm in no way obligated by courts or anything else to remain. And I feel like it may be inhibiting my progress...Maybe this whole thing is simply the required red tape that I need to cut in order to remain sober and free of drugs. The proverbial spiritual test...Any advice would be lovely I appreciate it.,6,7gni8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7gni8t/seeking_some_advice_on_my_sober_living_house/,19,2017-11-30T11:27:03
thrownaway33487,Different thought to the meaning 11th tradition,The 11th tradition suggests that we not promote the program as it could do it harm. We all have heard the tale in the rooms of if someone who was promoting the program happened to relapsed it would put the program into a bad light...But what about ourselves? The 11th tradition from a personal aspect suggests us not promoting ourselves by telling people we are in the program. By following this suggestion we focus on ourselves prevent putting pressure ourselves and give ourselves a break...Think of it this way... We have all have joined or have known someone who has joined a gym. In the beginning we are all gong-ho and go everyday and tell everyone we know that we are going to the gym to look better and feel better. Most people give us praise while a few laugh at us wanting us to fail. Problem is that we might only start to focus on the people laughing at us and begins build a resentment towards them. Slowly we quit going to the gym because now going to the gym becomes about them and showing them up and not about ourselves...Staying focused on ourselves and wanting to improve our own lives is what will keep us wanting to work the program.,1,7gmczo,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7gmczo/different_thought_to_the_meaning_11th_tradition/,3,2017-11-30T08:35:42

pale_shawty,I relapsed and I hate myself for it,Title says it all. ..I've relapsed and feel shit about it. I went to one AA meeting told myself I didn't need to go again. One night on a date I had a glass of wine felt fine. Another night had 2 beers and smoked some pot fine. This Saturday planned and told friends I wasn't drinking somehow ended up at a bar... 4 beers shots I don't even know. Thankful I didn't stick around to do drugs with a friend later though I deeply wanted to and would've if my other friend didn't tell me to go home. I blacked out most of the night. ..I was so depressed the next day for doing this to myself. I'm scared to reach out to my friend again about AA because I'm worried she'll be disappointed in me or not want to support me anymore... though I know she'd never feel that way. She told me even if I drink again she'll still support me. But I don't want to admit it. I don't want her to think I'm using her. I don't want to trigger her though she's a mentor for people. ..I still find myself thinking  I'm not as bad as them so I don't need AA I just need more willpower . I am so hung up on perfectionism and wanting to do everything myself and not admitting I need help. And I'm afraid of this pattern. No I don't drink every day. I was able to go a couple weeks without drinking. I don't even feel the urge to drink really like an aversion is there. But man as soon as I have one it's done. And I clearly felt an urge on Saturday night. ..I'm so pissed off at myself. The problem is I still don't see myself as a person with a problem because I don't drink every day and I don't have terrible withdrawals but here I am. ,0,7g0r2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7g0r2d/i_relapsed_and_i_hate_myself_for_it/,11,2017-11-27T21:33:01

WildSassyFree,Missing meetings and relapsing.,Hello. Im still pretty new to AA. Luckily my city has a lot of different groups. But i suffer from depression too and i feel sometimes going to aa is just so exhausting. Once im there im so happy im there yet i feel myself struggling to get to my meetings. I got so drunk lastnight and feel so sick today. Im tired of relapsing i feel like aa is judging me everytime i relapse but i should know that im not the first person to have relapses. I feel its jusy my paranoia when i tell fellow aa members that i keep failing while everyone else seems to be saying sober. I just feel my life is so boring without alcohol. With my depression nothing is enjoyable sober. Yet i know the more sobriety i have the depression willl get better. I just need to find thay strength to be patient i  know im not gunna feel better immediately. How can i find strength to stay sober?

jeramoon,Desperate to begin,I am chomping at the bit like a madwoman...craving not alcohol...but to begin the step work. This is my 2nd serious attempt at working the program and I am (maybe too) eager to start. I have been going to meetings looking for a sponsor...but not one soul has resonated with me. ..A year ago I first tried the program. I guess then I didn't really understand it all. I have a much bigger perspective now after a year of trying desperately to remain sober only to repeatedly relapse every month month and a half. I finally surrender that I am an alcoholic and I need help. I know I cannot go at this alone and be successful. ..During my first attempt I got a sponsor. She was 24 and I am 30. We had a lot in common and clicked. We were both exotic dancers. (Very rare to meet other dancers in recovery all I know are actively using) We started reading the BB and talking about the program and she had a lot of direction and information. At about our 4 or 5th meeting her boyfriend and her broke up. Our meetings became about THAT. I stopped going to group meetings because I felt normal...she got back with her boyfriend and was "busy" with all that. I abandoned my sobreity. ..I guess I feel like need to be extremely cautious of who I choose to sponsor me because of my previous experience. I REALLY want this thing I am excited to work the program. I even say this in meetings and nobody approaches me. Does anybody have advice for me on how to get a GOOD sponsor???

10lovesongs,Limerence in early sobriety,So i'm now 10 days sober after a relapse - going to meetings praying meditating - I've realised after the first few days of feelings up and down - i'm now in a state of Limerence with sobriety - the first flushes of love and infatuation...I notice this and think 'oh well use this energy to get stuck into your recovery'..My sponsor says I've changed and now I seem to be 'getting it' by what i'm sharing...Of course i'm mad being an alcoholic - so I worry - I catastrophise - 'oh God I feel so good so inevitably it will come crashing down' - it's almost a 'speedy' feeling (I've tried most drugs in the past) in that I struggle to sleep (entirely normal at this stage I agree)..I often read early sobriety is miserable and hard work so REALLY did not expect to feel like this?..Anyone else have a similar experience? If so how did it pan out?..Many thanks in advance,10,7bn1g2,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7bn1g2/limerence_in_early_sobriety/,13,2017-11-08T12:56:42
pop-otter,Choosing a fellowship,To try to make a long story short:..Cannabis is my drug of choice with alcohol as relatively infrequent substitute.  I originally got clean &amp; sober in 1997 at age 20 and had 15 years in Narcotics Anonymous...Life got good house wife 2 big careers 3 little kids.  I got complacent and relapsed 3+ years ago.  Got caught admitted to my wife last week and reached out to a friend who I knew outside the rooms and went to my 1st AA mtg last week because that's his fellowship...Questioning now in which fellowship I'll continue my recovery.  In one sense it's all the same.  With the way my life is now (see wife kids 2 careers) AA seems a lot easier logistically.  As case in point:  there is 1 noon NA meeting in San Francisco today and it's a women's meeting far from my office.  There are ten noon(ish) AA meetings a couple pretty convenient. ..On the flip side at the AA meeting I went to last night a sentence like this was literally in the meeting opener: "If your problem is primarily with a substance other than alcohol we recommend you try a different 12-step fellowship but hope you hear something useful here."  And it also seems potentially awkward if I'm eventually asked to speak at an AA meeting and my story is not primarily about alcohol...What say you AAs?,8,7bflg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7bflg6/choosing_a_fellowship/,13,2017-11-07T14:33:12
Aathrowaway2580,I'm really struggling tonight. I want to go to sleep and not wake up.,I need some words of encouragement. I haven't had a drink in about 4 days and frankly I don't want a drink but residual problems from my constant relapsing are weighing heavy on me right now. ..A little background. My drinking got really heavy about two years ago about a handle of vodka a day. It was a huge strain on my relationship with my wife. Not for me I didn't care. It was tough for my wife. I did 6 weeks of outpatient in February of last year and bought a bottle on my way home from my graduation. I hid it for about 2 months before my wife said "fuck it I don't care." She's never really been to invested in my recovery because I wasn't either. Earlier this year I went back to hiding it getting caught every couple of weeks. ..July of this year she had enough and demanded I go to an inpatient treatment center. I did for 30 days and managed to stay sober for about 6 weeks going to meetings twice daily and working a part time job when I'm capable of much more. I was starting to see those promises the big book talks about but it wasn't enough for me. I had to have a drink. She's caught me numerous times since then threatened divorce took away my credit cards and any access to money aside from my paycheck from my part time job. ..Later I lost my job because I didn't go in one day and I was on a provisional basis because my boss knew I was an alcoholic. I got home that day and told her that I would bust my ass and get a job within a week and I did. I got two job offers (one of which I started today) and I'm going to take the other one once all my background checks go through. I'm getting back to working in an insurance office with pretty good pay. If anything losing the job lit a fire under my ass. Know I know that this little bit of success doesn't erase years of putting her through hell but the way she treats me is starting to wear on me. It's like I don't even want to try because regaining her trust and getting our marriage back to where it was is going to take forever. I don't know if my emotional state can take it much longer. I love her more than anything in the world but I don't know if I can hold on to my sanity much longer. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. I'm too chicken shit to kill myself but it hurts so much to live like this. I know that if she leaves me I'll drink myself to death within weeks. ..I'm feeling worthless even though things are going well in some aspects of my life. ..I guess to wrap it up I know I deserve the way she treats me but I can't even get a "Hey good job on getting out there and getting not one but two jobs." It's just harrassment and knocking me down. I just need some encouragement.,6,7baxzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7baxzq/im_really_struggling_tonight_i_want_to_go_to/,7,2017-11-06T23:46:39
storm1119,Sober and alone,I went to rehab in February and have relapsed once since. It was about 5 months ago. Ever since I got out of treatment I haven't been able to hang out with my old friends and haven't made any new ones. I live with my parents and I'm 24. They let me use their car but only if they approve of where I'm going. I understand that.  I got a new job a few weeks ago (first job since rehab) in an attempt to make friends. It turns out there's not much talking in the position I'm in. I've been so lonely it makes me depressed and want to drink or die. My self esteem is so low lately. I'm a trans guy but I'm ashamed of all of that. I haven't had sex in over 2 years. I find meetings boring as hell but I'm starting to consider going to LGBT meetings to see old rehab "friends" and try and make new ones. The thing is that is stopping me is my depression accompanied with being exhausted from work. All I wanna do is lay in bed and wait until the next day. Does it get better? I know I'm not strong enough to be around people who are drinking and I'm also ashamed to have it come out that I'm an alcoholic. Can I get some advice or reassurance? This really sucks,5,79r0kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/79r0kp/sober_and_alone/,15,2017-10-30T17:48:59

PhukdNtheHead,I've been on a long dry drunk and I'm looking to end that today,Greetings /r/AA..I really just need to unload I hope that's alright..I live in a city in Mexico that's about an hour outside of Guadalajara. My city isn't nearly as developed and diverse as Guadalajara therefore the only "AA" meetings that are in my city are utter shit. &gt;1 hour there's no organization everyone wants to hear themselves talk so you'll have a speaker at the podium (that's how old school these meetings are) talk AT you for 20 minutes... Then the next guy. Who says the same things are the speaker before him. Ad infinitum. Needless to say I don't attend these meetings ..I've been sober for a little over three and a half years and for the first year of my sobriety (In California) I hit at least one meeting every day for 7 months. I never felt better healthier and more whole in my entire life than I did in that 7 month period. After that I moved to Mexico to be with my family and work in our family business and I stopped going to meetings for lack of availability (at least that's my excuse) ..I had been gradually feeling myself slip back into my old patterns of thinking. My cynicism towards life was back. My fear of abandonment returned wreaking havoc in my love life. My patience and willingness to forgive were gone. I chalked all this up to "Well I'm working as a manager in my family's business. Of course I'm going to be a bit drawn and overextended I have more responsibility today than I did when I first got sober and could attend meetings every day." I simply wasn't prioritizing my recovery and only by my Higher Power's grace have I not relapsed. ..I recently got engaged in September and this time that's supposed to be happy and joyful has been completely overwhelming. Between wedding planning and just plain old learning how to be engaged I've just completely run out of steam. My fianc e and I have planned for her to move from her city to mine (about a 6 hour drive) and she's expressed interest in working in my business which is awesome. Last night she says how she enjoys an active and self-motivated lifestyle and maybe she would like to go to school to get a certification to be able to translate as a side project after we're married. Being an alcoholic with no recovery program my mind went from 0 to 100 in the blink of an eye and instantly thought "Oh fuck I'm going to be stuck in this marriage where my wife isn't going to make time for me; why the hell would she willingly extend herself that much when she already has a job and a career lined up; ugh I'm going to be second priority and this isn't what I signed up for maybe she's just using me to springboard into a new chapter in her life; I'm only 25 and already my marriage is going to be a dead bedroom because she won't have time for me; I have things I'd like to do too but when you get married priorities change doesn't she know that?"..All this because she said maybe she'd like to continue a hobby and do something she enjoys. It hasn't even been set in stone or decided. We aren't even married. That isn't normal..So after I had finished almost having an anxiety attack I went onto my balcony smoked a cigarette (don't tell her lol) and prayed. I prayed long and hard to my Higher Power realizing that I had wandered and gone astray. I needed my God to bring me back to Himself to break down the walls of bullshit that I had slowly and subconsciously been building up around myself during this time that I haven't gone to meetings. I need to be renewed rejuvenated and refreshed. I need spiritual strength because every time I've  tried to rely on my own strength I've failed. I am powerless ..I researched English speaking meetings in Guadalajara and I found one that I'm going to attend tomorrow. Sure it's less than idea to have to drive an hour and a half to a meeting. Sure I'll have to leave work early. Sure I'll probably be able to only make one meeting a week. But I need to cling to recovery like a fucking life preserver because I'll drown in this world if I don't have it. I need to prioritize my own emotional sobriety and my own recovery above all else because without it I wouldn't have any of the other wonderful blessings and gifts that I have received while sober. I need to take responsibility and own my sobriety. I am not fixed I need continual maintenance ..If you've gotten this far thank you for letting me vent. Have a great 24 guys,2,78vhdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/78vhdc/ive_been_on_a_long_dry_drunk_and_im_looking_to/,7,2017-10-26T09:18:10
Notningamaster,I admit I am powerless over alcohol surrender,I've been to lots of meetings I am the guy that used by AA as a dumping ground or would go to prove to others  I was going to get sober basically I was a human chair warmer with lots of beginner chips...I didn't understand bottom now things are way worse I am a broken man crying and I get it... It hurts so bad but just now was the first time I admitted my thinking be gets me nowhere I give up I am done...An old timer asked after a relapse what changes this time I said I am going to go to more meetings he said wrong answer I hope you don't die before you found the right one. Then he walked off and didn't answer my follow up question. I get it now! I am getting a sponsor today if possible by and begging for step work ASAP. I surrender and I pray I get the promises.,6,78qxs3,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/78qxs3/i_admit_i_am_powerless_over_alcohol_surrender/,6,2017-10-25T17:32:49
10lovesongs,Cross posting from stop drinking as it involves AA - hope you don't mind,OK - all speech is a demand. No one can tell me to stop drinking no one can absolve me or say 'hey it's OK' - so i guess I'm looking for identification. If you read and recognise and can let me know that'd help. What I know doesn't help me is the pejorative 'oh grow up'/'man up'/'suck it up'. And maybe someone is in a similar position to me?...So i'm addicted to most things pleasurable - only one I've avoided (so far touch wood) is gambling. But psychedelics weed sex alcohol food computers........I live in a small village married - no kids...Stopped the drugs but sex and drinking continued. Went to AA - managed 2 months sober but relapsed. Started counselling weekly - good counsellor. Realised shame a big part of it. Difficult childhood and early 20s PTSD type stuff - not an excuse but definitely a trigger...Stopped drinking again. But the sex continued - very depressed felt AA not for me stopped going. I get fed up of people saying how happy they were and i was sober 6m and where was my happiness? I'd a sponsor and was up to Step 6 (telling in itself). I'd hate it when people said 'it's not a buffet you have to do it all' - no problem with the HP bit of steps/traditions to the letter but the big book - whilst wise in places is not the word of God - it's sexist and dated and full of holes. I felt i had to shut up couldn't speak out about that...Course it wasn't for me as I had a secret - sex. Stopped that last month with therapy as a start (I'm under no illusions I'll always be tempted). I then had a sexual hook up with a big book thumping member of AA - that proved to me at the time that it was full of shit. ..So that was 8 months ago. 3 months ago i lapsed back to drinking. Tried TSM sadly didn't work for me - side effects and just........missed the buzz! So OK every other day? Sure - then weekly? Sure! Then - screw it!..My drinking now is 'functional' - not to blackout or making an arse of myself or being belligerent. Just sad and lonely and trying to obliterate the existential sadness and void that I feel during the day. It's going to kill me either through liver disease or suicide - i drink 140U/week - so I know that will do it after a few years maybe sooner. My life is on hold. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to (cant have kids - big loss for me)..I'm extremely depressed. On antidepressants but they don't have a chance in hell of working if I'm drinking. ..So contacted my 'sponsor' - I put it in quotes to mean I hadn't spoken to him for 6 months - we met for coffee and I was glad I did. I'd chosen him for good reason...Me: The big book is NOT perfect it's written by a mortal so can't be!.Him: Who told you that?.Me: [Old timer] in a share.Him: It's bullshit it's full of holes.Me: So why does [old timer] keep saying 'it's not a buffet and I should do exactly what the big book says?'.Him: Who told you that?.Me: [Oldtimer] - promise - more than once occasion.Him: Tell him to fuck off people like that are toxic...He also said going to AA enabled him to have the happiest times of his life - outside of AA. This floored me - I had thought AA meant you could only have fun with other AA people and if you left you were doomed - so therefore it was a cult. ..But here I am - drinking and miserable. I'm going to meet a potential new sponsor on Friday but as my drinking is at the 'not yet' stage I'm still holding off - a world of pain awaits when i stop. But. Also there's the potential to live my life fully - I have a great spouse (not addict) a great job I have great skills..........I'm just terrified of stopping and people telling me to 'suck it up' as I have a strong belief my mood will get worse when i stop. Also I'll be loathing the people who can still drink. I read 'Naked Mind' and sure it's good but it's like a parent saying 'cos i told you so' - my belief (i hope it's false) is that life in recovery sucks. You're like Woody Allen on the train in Stardust Memories - in a monochrome world looking over at people having fun and I just can't join in..........If I give up I know I can't do it alone - I need to go to AA and 'suck it up' a little bit. I get sad that drug addicts can't attend and that few people will understand sexual addiction. I'm fucking terrified. I know I have to stop but I'm so scared...And that's my story - no happy ending........just where I'm at .

DirtyFerdi,Am I too picky with my sponsor?,So I am feeling as though I'm building a resentment with my sponsor. Someone said to me If your sponsor doesnt make your 4th step their not doing it right. Haha right? But I'm not sure this is what they meant. ..Also! This is my 4th sponsor already and I feel as though perhaps I am being too picky or maybe I can't stay with one Becasue it's my way of putting the real work off. However I don't THINK that's the case. My first sponsor relapsed her sponsor took me on but she has so many sponsees and it was clear she took me Becasue she felt obligated too and clearly didn't have much time to work with me. I grabbed someone else real quick so I could get out of that situation sponsor #3 who I left because I think I grabbed her just to get out of situation #2 and it became clear quickly her sobriety was pretty anger-fueled which I did not want. So I got #4 who is very sweet but seemed really gung-ho to sponsor me but now it seems like she doesn't have the time or the drive I feel like I need. ..I think I'm very good at seeming ok when I am not so perhaps that's why she is moving so slowly. We have only done step one so far (incredibly thoroughly) but we have been together for almost two months. She continually reschedules and does not seem appropriately responsive when I try to tell her I am struggling. I was having a freak out this weekend and felt the closest to drinking than I have since I've gotten here and when I told her this via text (i was on a 3 hour bus ride sitting next to a normie friend and couldnt call her) she gave me a pretty short response back and told me that going to a meeting and asking for help would be the right thing to do. She didn't follow up with me at all about it or text me back when I said "ok". ..Her nonchalant attitude seeming to not have the time and how slowly We are going through the steps is what make me want to find a new sponsor. She's really nice though and I think sensitive and I dont want to hurt her feelings. I also feel like a flake if I breakup with ANOTHER sponsor. But I feel like my sobriety is suffering By staying with her. ..I'm going to meet with her today finally and I think tell her my concerns and see how she responds. ..Thanks for letting me post here. I think I just needed to get my thoughts out somewhere but if anyone has anything related or advice I'd love to hear it.,2,7783yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/7783yt/am_i_too_picky_with_my_sponsor/,13,2017-10-18T13:23:48

Tinari,Hey kinda a new guy just posting here. New date Thursday at 7PM. But here I am on Monday/Tuesday. I work Monday night till about 11PM till Tuesday morning and as I type this relapse is inbound.,I even hear it in a dumb voice.  In my head.  I typed it "oh relapse is inbound" in the voice of a great let's-play person.  But then I have to work so I've been steady and just... I'm.. I have Tuesday evening off Wednesday off and Thursday off..  this is going to be the period I need the most help and the most "attaboy!" compliments.  I think that feels petty and stupid... but seriously... you guys don't know my dad hah...Anyway... I have been home and relaxing.  I can't sleep.  It's all nightmares night sweats and night tremors from the 7-8 days ago and I am trying to detox.  I guess I am doing good as all my employees STILL say I am A+ and the best and I do so much...But this weekend is coming and I think I will fail... but... because I think I will fail am I allowing myself to fail? (Oh you KNOW you are weak drink screw up) but I don't know.  I have no faith in me and I know in some places that's "self grandising" or something but seriously... Thursday at 9PM at my local church near the Kroger there is Alcoholics Anonymous and I will go.  I will go.  My dad insulted me the only time he saw me about that.  "Will you show up to AA drunk" and I said "Yes.  If they send me away well I made a chance but otherwise they're people who're helping"..Sorry I'm just spewing a bit but with zero friends I have tons to spew but nothing to listen to.

sparklyderp,I just need to vent to anyone.,I'm 10 months sober from alcohol. I'm a nursing assistant and I'm going to school to become a registered nurse. That's what I want to do with my life. So a little background.. I have scoliosis and chronic migraines. So to cope with my pain I smoke weed. Which doesn't cause problems at all for me because it helps me sleep and the body pain goes away. I got randomly drug tested at work because some idiot put a narcotic in the paper shredder. Lol. My heart sank and my future went down the tubes right before my eyes. So luckily I found a way to pass the drug test. I know this won't ever happen again where I'd get a little heads up before a drug test. So I feel the universe is telling me to stop smoking weed. I'm devastated and terrified. I'm so disgusted with how people can just go buy alcohol and abuse that but someone who could benefit from weed can't because of their job. Why is alcohol legal and weed isn't.. alcohol is so horrible I wish it never existed.. yet people can just casually drink...??? And I can easily get pain killers for pain but I don't want to get addicted to those? It makes no sense. Basically I just feel lost right now. I enjoyed my time smoking and going to bed. But anyways I'm glad I'm sober from alcohol and just need to find another thing to replace weed. I was thinking about getting back into kickboxing. But that's like 100 a month so I can't afford that at the moment. I'm super impatient too.. sorry I'm rambling. Anyways why is alcohol okay but weed isn't. Makes me very upset. Why do I have to be an alcoholic. Pisses me off. Btw I can't drink anymore anyways because 1 it gives me panic attacks and I go into a deep depression (which is a blessing in disguise) 2 it ruins my life lol. So no I won't relapse on alcohol ever again. But fuck. ,1,76opt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/76opt7/i_just_need_to_vent_to_anyone/,11,2017-10-16T02:35:40

feelincucked,Dad relapsed not sure what to do,Feeling sick to my stomach right now. My dad was clean since 2008 and I still live with him. I hadn't drank anything in my stash for a while and I was gonna pour myself a glass tonight...only to find that the bottle was half gone and I know I'd barely even touched it. I showed it to him and he absolutely denied it and told me to "retrace my steps" (right...like I drank half a bottle of jack daniels the night before I had class and work...). My mom thought I was onto something and we looked in his car. We found 2 fifths of vodka...Idk...I'm just so disappointed in him. He did really good in rehab and stayed clean for so long and I really thought that was gonna be the end of it. If he continues this he's going to ruin his 25 year marriage with my mom because I know she's not going to put up with round 2 now that the kids are all grown up.....It's clear that he's very in denial about it. My mom has a very short temper and is a very stressful person so she's likely going to make it worse so what is something I can do to help him back on the path?.,3,76hwch,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/76hwch/dad_relapsed_not_sure_what_to_do/,11,2017-10-15T04:38:09
myworkhandle,Facing repercussions and eating humility,So I've been struggling with relapse repeatedly since getting back into the rooms a few months back.  So much to the point that last week I was drunk 6 of 7 days including 2 days of drinking AT WORK.  As if I didn't learn my lesson from recently getting fired from my previous job on account of my drinking- related bullshit.   ..I neglected to do a system check which now throws some data in question.   It's a first time  and minor mistake but one that will cause some documentation to be filed noting my negligence.   These things happen to everyone but I especially internalize failure (like a true alcoholic amirite?)  and now with even more remorse because I know alcohol was involved.  ..And though I now have 3 days sober again and felt on top of the world yesterday I have to accept my short-comings  admit to them and walk through the consequences like an adult.  ..I heard so many good things at the meeting I attended last night- if I hadn't gone I could be taking this a lot worse.   In fact I may have even lied to try and cover this up which in reality would be 1000000x worse than what I did/didn't do.  ..I'll keep coming back.  Thanks for being there everyone.

10lovesongs,Is AA right for me?,Hi there - I've commented but no posted yet - I'm posting to see if anyone identifies and can relate or has been through similar..Involves 12 step - I am not anti 12 step! It works for some not all but didn't work for me at the time.......so wondered why.........So i'm middle aged in a small UK town - history of drug abuse sex addiction overeating..... - stopped the drugs the sex addiction continued (was told in rehab i wasn't there for sex addiction just drug addiction - i hadn't laid a finger or suggested having sex with anyone else but they picked up on something i said in a group therapy session)...So couple of years ago after bouts of depression and having addressed food and drug addiction realised I had a problem with alcohol - still working etc. but realised it was not healthy. Started attending AA....the people nice and as my rehab had been 12 step i had no problem with the higher problem thing..What I'd thought was a slogan - 'take what you need and leave the rest behind' - was being disputed in meetings. 'It's not a buffet' - you had to believe it all or nothing. And then 'the big book is perfect' - it cant be it was written by a person but a deity - and calling it perfect is making it religious. ..And i realised i couldn't read out 'rarely have we seen a person fail who didn't follow our program' and i shared 'what's the evidence??' - there wasn't any. The rooms full of people who it had worked for or it had hope it would work for them - but no one to say 'no it didn't work for me'...I got a sponsor - well he approached me but people said he had a lot of clean time and I was in good hands. And yup he's a nice guy I didn't and don't dislike him I have a lot of time for him.  So then I  started working the steps - after 2 months i lapsed one day - lots of shame about for me and it was shame that lead me to lapse..I rang my sponsor and told him he said I'd been selfish in lapsing and I felt like an utter failure. ..After a few months I continued on step work and had heard Step 5 was really a turning point. I'd pray each day meditate went to meetings 3-4 per week..I worked on Step 5 over 4-6 weeks and put everything into it - shared with sponsor. Expected something.......but was presented with a horoscopic chart of opposite attributes......and from what I'd put down it ticked most of the boxes. Nothing new to learn there - nothing insightful. No recognition. My sponsor was being pleasant and all but I'd expected more identification or something....not sure. ..Xmas came - i had more thoughts about drinking - but i'd been lead to believe that the urge would soon leave. I shared in a meeting that despite being 6m sober and working the steps all i could I still thought a lot about alcohol..After meeting a lady i liked who was humble and had 13 years sobriety came up to me after and said 'oh course you do! you're an alcoholic' - i was utterly surprised. I'd thought the people in the rooms who were working the steps were free from cravings - particularly over Xmas - yes a lot of alcohol about but I'd been told we would rarely think about it? ..Despite being sober from alcohol my sex addiction continued. One guy who had come up to me (as I was a newcomer when i'd started) who was attractive contacted me and we had very basic sexual fun. He was quite high up in the AA hierarchy in terms of meeting boards and service. I'd hoped i could talk to him about the sex addiction i contacted him to see if he was 'OK' - he blanked it and denied all knowledge of it...I still felt depressed. I hear talk of 'other meetings' but there's no sex addiction meetings in my area. I cant attend NA due to work (it's a good job but very boundaried working with drug addicts)..So - I want to stop alcohol. I'm receiving help for sex addiction no drugs - I'd love to go back to AA for the mutual aid..But.......I'd love to hear other people's opinions on these:..1) Rarely have we seen a person fail......I've heard stories of many for whom it didn't work - and i don't believe it was because they were incapable of being honest to themselves..2) You have to follow the program by the letter - it's not a buffet - in contrast to what I'd seen re 'take what you need leave the rest behind'.3) Do the cravings go? I'd been told by sponsor that anyone reporting cravings was not doing the steps properly.4) Being told i was selfish for relapsing - having been to boarding school I was often mocked that my crying for parents who weren't there was selfish. So if I'm told this it just relives that memory of 'oh we cant cope with this so FFS grow up!'.5) Why follow the big book to the letter? - it was written by a person not a deity so it cannot be infallible. It's full of things that might have seemed sensible in the 1930s but nowadays very sexist and out of touch....Absolutely not having a go at AA - this is my experience - I know it works for some but not for all......But please don't tell me to 'grow up' etc. - as explained it doesn't work on me...But I'd love hear any possible similar experiences or views? :)..Thank you for reading :) Am cross posting to a few sites.......,8,759zbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/759zbt/is_aa_right_for_me/,11,2017-10-09T11:54:31
Ylimeq15,Introducing yourself as a newcomer after you've relapsed is the worst thing ever.,Or that's what I kept telling myself. I actually just did it for the first time at my home group and I feel so much better. I worked it up in my head as we often do but it wasn't so bad. So if you're scared like I was don't be. The hardest part is getting to that first meeting. Xx ,15,745e8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/745e8u/introducing_yourself_as_a_newcomer_after_youve/,9,2017-10-03T22:48:17
aleisha3,I'm back on it. 36 hours sober.,I went to treatment back in July 2014 went 9 months being sober then relapsed. It would be about 2-3 months sober then drink. Then less &amp; less time in between... Until now when a bunch of hard shit came my way &amp; I started drinking 4-5x/week. Not an excuse but it is the reason why. Being sad is addictive. I'm fucking done with it and I'm so stoked on life!...So. I'M BACK ON IT. ONE DAY AT A TIME. It's the only way I'll ever stay sober otherwise I'll get mad at how many times I've fucked up. My Sober Time app told me this morning:...**"The secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old but on building the new."**...PEACE CHILL AND POSITIVE VIBES EVERYONE! &lt;3,23,724yie,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/724yie/im_back_on_it_36_hours_sober/,8,2017-09-24T09:12:58
BayouBroug,Early recovery. 4 relapses this year but I still show up and work at,,29,71wcip,https://i.redd.it/9fasks8rbknz.jpg,10,2017-09-23T00:45:53
ajwesten,3 years sober/My very first relapse,Backstory:..I am an alcoholic .I have been sober for three years. Until now. Last night is my only night off which is the night I go to dinner with my mom. This happens every week for the past year or so and we normally meet up choose where she would like me to take her for dinner then we eat after our meal we always go to the local bar (my second home when I drank and where most of my good friends usually hang about). I have NEVER broken my sobriety in 3 years because when my mom drinks at the bar and socializes with friends I spend my time playing pool and hanging out with my friends. It has never been an issue refraining from alcohol while at the bar because all of my friends are supportive and don't even offer. ..Where my night begins ..I met up with my mom at her house and we did the usual and struggled to pick where we were going. Once we picked we headed off to a restaurant close by. I listen to the weekly gossip and my mom catching me up about the family. After dinner we headed to the bar and it was unusually busy for the Thursday night. One of my best friends came home from the military and I completely blanked that I was invited to his welcoming home gathering at the bar. Perfect I get to have a chat with my mother and show up to the party! So long story short my mom wanted to go home a few hours later (10pm) so I dropped her off at her house right down the street and headed back to celebrate with my friends. Like I said all of my friends are respectful of my sobriety so there was never a problem with pressure to drink. After hanging out for another hour or two most of the guys left and it's was just the close circle of about five guys. We've have all been close friends for 12 years (freshman in high school). We are all pretty much brothers from another motha. We did our fair share of partying and getting into trouble. So I am playing pool shootin the shit and teasing each other as usual and then it pretty much goes black from then on out. ..Turns out my friend from the military challenged me that I couldn't out drink him. In our group I was the one who drank excessive amounts of alcohol ever time we hung out and this particular friend was the one who we always teased for being a lightweight and always the first one passed out. Apparently the first 10 times he challenged me I said fuck off no way because 1. I'm sober and 2. I didn't believe him. I apparently beside my side that he actually thought he could out drink me. Turns out I can still out drink everyone in my group haha but he has gotten better. Then we started with one full bottle of Markers Mark whiskey each and whoever finished it first won. Don't ask me why because I don't know. I guess I justified it by saying only once because he is home and I could never see him again. I guess I had a fucking awesome night and had a killer time. One of my other good friends is the bartender so he locked the doors and let us stay after last call (2am I was trashed by then). At about 4am I was one bottle of makers mark 2 vodka sodas and two IPA's deep. We decided to head home right after 4 so they called an Uber but I decided to walk to my moms house to sleep. This morning I woke up at sitting in my bathtub completely hungover and still a little drunk and feeling the biggest feeling of regret. I feel completely defeated. Something I was so passionate about I just blew it all away just because. I know I had a great fucking time with my friends but we always do I didn't need alcohol for the fun. I am definitely paying for it today. But whatever day one again. Time to start over. ..,1,71to4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/71to4o/3_years_sobermy_very_first_relapse/,4,2017-09-22T16:16:27
Derkenoff,High-bottom young person - I have a year sober (again),So I wanted to make a post for three reasons:..1) to suggest to people who might be exploring this page that you don't need a dui or jail or homelessness or to lose a job etc to be an alcoholic. When I first got sober at 19 I was at a prestigious university full time and working part time and had lots of hobbies/friends. I realized I needed to get sober because I was empty inside. I had lost my spirit and I began to obsess over drinking/using whenever I wasn't intoxicated. You don't need to keep going down the path your on that might lead to institutions or jails if you're struggling with substance (ab)use if you get really quite with yourself you might realize on some level you cannot be your best self using/drinking...2) getting sober while young can be awesome. I have so many amazing friends from the program who are my age and who more importantly I relate to. My biggest concern about getting sober was "what will I do now for fun?!?" Which probably indicated I had a problem. But after a couple months sober I felt comfortable in my skin I could be myself again and there are so many great things to do all of the time that I can't keep up. ..3) if you relapse (or need more "research") you can ALWAYS go back and be welcomed openly..I had 4 years sober and then 1.5 years ago I relapsed. Because I was a "high bottom drunk" and I thought "maybe my issue was with drugs but I don't think I was really an alcoholic" I did more research. The thing is if you're obsessed about whether or not you're an alcoholic drinking is going to suck... it will never feel right. After 6 month of drinking my life was legit falling apart but it was insane how much power and serenity came getting honest that I was an alcoholic with the people I am close to. I thought I was going to need rehab for the first time because I couldn't stop drinking but right after I told the 3 most important people in my life "I am an alcoholic" and went to a meeting and told a room of understanding people "I am an alcoholic" the obsession was gone. ..If you could see where my life was a year ago and where it is now you would be shocked. If you think you might have a drinking problem go to a meeting and listen. .,16,71rt03,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/71rt03/highbottom_young_person_i_have_a_year_sober_again/,10,2017-09-22T11:41:36
gratefulnotdead,First Post. Day 2. My username says it all.,As a huge Grateful Dead fan and someone who has escaped death more times than I can count I thought this would be the most fitting username I could choose. ..I really want to get back into journalling my sobriety journey so here are my random thoughts from the last week one that has been a whirlwind of ups and downs. I've been in and out of the rooms for a little over 3 years now. Two trips to rehab. Multiple felony arrests flatline overdoses blah blah blah war story shit no one wants to hear. I earned my fucking seat at the tables let's just put it that way. The longest period of sobriety I had was a year but it was a joke. I wasn't the spiritual guru I was leading people to believe I was and I got more of a rush into tricking people into thinking I worked a solid program rather than the actual relief I felt from two real months of working a real program later on. That's a story for another day though...A month ago I moved to a new city from the college town I lived in for 7 years. A town I fell in and out of love in with more times than my dog licks his balls every day. I had to get out because *of course* it was the town's fault that I couldn't stay sober not mine. You know how that story goes we all know the mind-altering substances always beat you to the airport before you even get off the plane...Life went from being terrible to just okay. I was managing. I said fuck AA I can live off marijuana maintenance and be just okay for the rest of my life. I ended up getting an amazing job my dream job ironically partly because one of my hiring project managers is in the program herself and I lied to her about how much time I had. ..Two weeks into my job I get a drug test and have to explain to this exact person in the program why I may or may not have failed the test. I make up a bullshit relapse story. She understands tells me to expect to be randomly tested again at some point. Can't smoke pot? No big deal at least I can go back to my old trusted friends alcohol and Xanax. A week later I have to go see my good ol' PO. I walk in there all high and mighty dressed up in my best suit thinking that will trick them not to drop the dreaded UA on me. **Boy was I wrong** ..I drop dirty. I plead with her not to violate me. *Ayyyyyy lemme get uhhhhhh the most desperate foxhole prayer ever please.* That's basically what I sounded like. ..Fuck it. I'm getting drunk. And I'm not going to work. I'm going to drink like I'm a wounded Civil War private and the surgeon is on his way with a rusty saw to cut my right leg off. Two days go by I'm still not at work and payday hits. For those of us alcoholics who use other hard substances you know how that story goes. My bender goes from that of a functioning buzzed Buzz Aldrin in Cape Canaveral to a strung out John Belushi stumbling on the set of Saturday Night Live in a matter of minutes. Before I even know it time has passed so quickly I realize I have to see my PO again in a few days. *I'm so fucked*..I wish I could tell you what it was but for the very first time in my drinking career I had actually had enough. Definitely not enough money or self-esteem but enough of the bullshit I've been putting my family my friends my co-workers and myself through. I had the exact experience that was talked about in the Big Book the same ones I scoffed at every time I read in a meeting or tried to share about half-heartedly to impress some newcomer. It was just like this excerpt from As Bill Sees It in today's Daily Reflections which I am so grateful I took the time to read this morning when I woke up:.&gt; "We admitted we couldn't lick alcohol with our own remaining resources and so we accepted the further fact that dependence upon a Higher Power (if only our A.A. group) could do this hitherto impossible job. The moment we were able to accept these facts fully our release from the alcohol compulsion had begun."..But this time was different than all the other times I felt that dreaded impending sense of doom. No more foxhole prayers. I got up and did something about it. I made calls. I was honest with others and most importantly myself. And you know what? Everything turned out *alright.* Not the exact way I wanted it to but that's just fine. I got another chance at life today and tomorrow I get another chance too. And that's fucking awesome. ..There's something this last week that hit me pretty hard and made me realize just how oblivious I am as an alcoholic to how my actions affect the ones I love. Last night into the early morning I had a very deep conversation with two of my normie roommate friends about the things going on in our lives. My one roommate whose father passed away unexpectedly just two weeks ago looks at me after I poured my heart out about my recent struggles. He said and I'll paraphrase this:..&gt; "The other day I had to walk into a church filled with hundreds of people mourning my father. I didn't expect that I would have had to do that so soon I thought that'd come way later in life. I don't want yours to be the next one I experience that feeling at." ..This has been a crazy emotional week for me. I only have two days sober but I have learned so much about myself and so much about what I need to do to get my life back on track. I have a great job a loving family caring friends an amazing dog and everything in the world to live for. ..I plan on coming to this subreddit a lot in addition to going to meetings just so I can remind myself of that every single day because when you're an alcoholic it's super easy to get caught up in the chaos of life and forget about all these wonderful things. As my old sponsor used to sign off after every telephone conversation we had where I was being a whiney spoiled jerk: *Find some gratitude asshole.*..,5,71900a,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/71900a/first_post_day_2_my_username_says_it_all/,7,2017-09-20T01:28:52

thrownaway33487,Relapsing and shaming,Truth be told every single one of us have relapsed numerous thousands of times throughout our lives. The thing was we never had the accountability or support of the rooms. If someone relapses we should never be on a high horse and shame them or even let them think we will shame them when they come back... This isn't high school...That said... The love and understanding of the rooms should not be used as an excuse to have a relapse. We are all here to support each other but never enable.,2,6zc8ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6zc8ph/relapsing_and_shaming/,9,2017-09-10T21:11:31
theapplecherry,Shame of relapse,I relapsed and I am too scared to go back to my meeting on Sunday. In terms of how bad it was - not too bad (considering how it used to be) finished half a bottle of Rum but got up and got to work and all that. ..I am scared of what they will say. They know because I called 3 of them - the closest ones to me - and told them. They didnt say anything bad but still... They know...Just feel like my whole walk to the meeting will feel like in Game of Thrones when cercei had to go naked down the roads and have that creep woman ring the bell and say Shame all the time. ..Felt like that today. ..Feel week. Cant sleep. Cant move. Cant think. ..My first failure since I went sober. ..UPDATE: Went to a meeting. Cried like a child and apologized to every single person in the room. EVERY SINGLE PERSON hugged me and inspired me to continue and not give up ever. I am sober. I will stay sober until I fall and if and when I do - I have a sickness and it is OK. AA is the place of love and compassion. I literally love you all right now. HUGS!,11,6yweu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6yweu6/shame_of_relapse/,19,2017-09-08T13:55:35
Paulapaul1,My sponsor relapsed,She started last April and I've just been pretending it didn't happen. Two weeks ago she showed up at a meeting wasted. No one noticed?  I did. I called her on it- I said "I love you and. Can tell you're fucked up." She lied. "No I'm not." She didn't tell her sponsor. She even chaired a couple nights later. She told me "thank you  for what you did. I was taking diet pills. I didn't have any business doing that. I wasn't drinking." At this point you can't walk in a straight line so who cares why? This woman has been dedicated to aa service work her big book her sponsor and her sponsors. Last night her husband called. "She needs help.  I need someone to come over." I've got 6 months sobriety. Seeing her like that was terrible but I was glad I was there and so was her sponsor. We all agreed to go to a noon mtg. I've relapsed constantly since I came in in 2014 and I thought well the worst is over. It'll be hard in her family and on her but she's stopping and we're on the road to redemption. I met them at the mtg today and she's STILL fucked up- the worst part is she's trying to play it off. Really? Spilled coffee talking guzzling water. I just want to shake her. I know I can't. Meanwhile I've had no sponsor since May and I'm really on the fence as to how honest I should be with her or if I should just disappear until she's better. This is not an AA acquaintance. This is my best friend in AA taught me how to get sober how to pray and how to keep coming back. ,12,6xrev5,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6xrev5/my_sponsor_relapsed/,14,2017-09-03T01:13:43

techie762,why wont you tell people the true history of Bill Wilson and admit the cultlike atmosphere of gov't/socially approved quit method organizations?,I'm sure i'll be banned immediately with no response just like in the groups for mentioning these true "heresies" and probably have my post deleted to prevent others from seeing it. but I don't care... ..even if you disagree with me entirely and fully believe in the things you say (which btw never helped me I had to help myself and use all the most unsanctioned evil methods to get off and stay off as far as you are concerned but it WORKED and therefore I am right. period)..even if you believe these things in the age of the internet you are doing more harm to yourselves and your organization by making up statistics and lying blatantly about the creation and initial organization of the group...why cant you tell people bill Wilson was A.) a bad man and a liar who embezzled money and took advantage of downtrodden addicted women in the groups sexually..and B.) was one of the first MAJOR success stories of LSD treatment of addiction in the 60s...these are all historically provable verifiable facts. whether you like them or not...theres a lot more like relapse rates underreporting or lying in the groups and more...also this belief of not allowing people to ease their symptoms with things that work (I agree with you on suboxone the shit is more evil than heroin but there are OTHER methods involving pot DXM ibogaine memantine and more that have high potential to help people if properly researched and applied in a controlled clinical setting.. too bad its illegal to do so and where it isn't pharmaceutical co's don't want to because it would lose billions in profit to actually cure people and spend money to research plant based substances that cannot be patented.)..I was my own test-dummy. I came from a background of bucket chemistry and DIY. I was highly intelligent believe in freedom the constitution and philosophy...I don't think drug court helps anyone only harms them. I don't think your organization helps many people (maybe some)...and I think that being honest about your origin and the potentials of ACTUAL science to help people rather than pseudoscience and fake history bullshit would do more to get and keep people off than anything else...we live in a new age where religion has little control over people and almost nobody can be helped by a 'higher power'. methodologies like SMART have been proven 100% more effective with lower lifelong relapse rates because of harm reduction rather than moral obsession...the fact that your methods are gov't approved damns the entire rehabilitation system to be nothing more than a Ponzi scheme that involves imprisonment and loss of rights helps feed the private prison industry and also creates a lucrative market in rehabs that don't actually get people off drugs in the long or short term merely replacing them with government sanctioned drugs and a belief in powerlessness that often leads to hopelessness despair and relapses that are worse than just one tiny mistake but end up with the 'fuck its' and binges...what we actually need is government supported (like welfare based not profit based) one time treatment methodologies that are in/out and do not base themselves on repeat customers for profit...and your dishonesty/coverup of the things I mentioned which will probably get me banned from this subreddit and WILL get you kicked out of the groups/rehabs for even MENTIONING (because its true and if people read up on it they will leave in DROVES and lose any/all faith in you)..this dishonesty only serves to work against you and get more people to leave as the internet becomes more common and it becomes easier to get that information and harder to keep it away from people in halfway houses etc who can sneak in phones and shit...tell the damn truth regardless of whether if benefits you...you might find that the more truth you tell the more people actually find a way that works for them to quit drugs that hurt them even if they don't quit everything and don't become one of you...because nobody is ever perfect but that doesn't mean we cannot become better...that does not mean your way is the only way and the gold standard for everyone...and right now your helping to demonize the very things that created your own group that helped the first man quit. Your obviously anti-science... we need methodologies this new age can morally identify with so that way they DO have the faith and strength to quit which you can no longer provide to everyone and its arguable if you ever did to begin with once it was organized and the truth tellers were gone leaving a socially acceptable and sterilized organization in its wake...and this can be seen in your main competitor NarcAnon -- which is ran directly by scientology kooks..,0,6xgkr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6xgkr8/why_wont_you_tell_people_the_true_history_of_bill/,31,2017-09-01T14:46:00
Diphthongsong,Dillusional ranting and a question,I am a heroin and meth addict. I love doing both at the same time (IV) but I will resentfully use one by itself if one of the two is unavailable. Tonight I relapsed on both after 14 days...I've been in and out of different 12 step fellowships since  2013 when a frienaddict suggested an NA meeting. ..My story: Began weed/alcohol in 03 &amp; in HS experimented every chance I got &amp; tried every type of drug. I tried meth at 15 &amp; used just about everyday for a year(give or take). I don't remember it being an intentional decision to stop but subconsciously I must've wanted to so I switched to weed/alcohol either drinking/smoking either b4 during but always after school. In college I stuck with weed&amp; used alcohol less frequently. Towards the end of school I tried a blue 30 mg Percocet (I remember my dealer telling me they didn't asprin) Over time my habit evolved  until 2 yrs later I tried heroin while I lived in NYC and began my addiction though it may have been there's b4 that. I had to move 3 times in a year &amp; 1/2 while I tried to sustain a living by selling pot. When I ran out of money I came back home&amp; started the process to become a teacher. When I came back to Texas I had access to H &amp; my old friend crystal meth reentered my life. a year later I started using both at the same time by IV. My habit increased to a .7 of H and .4 CM at the height of my addiction. I frequently pawned my music equipment stole school instruments and got payday loans to make it month to month. finally admitted and asked for my parents help Jan'15 &amp; went to treatment in June. Tried to do stop by having my parents live with me monitoring my.$ &amp; as the accountability let up I relapsed..1st rehab used mostly a clinical approach&amp;mentioned AA &amp;had meetings brought in. After that I had 6 months while cherry picking how to work my program. Since then I've  been in &amp; out for weeks/months at a time. AnotherDetox in Feb'16 &amp; most recently 3 month 12 step heavy rehab Dec'16. When I got out I got a sponsor got service commitments &amp; worked the steps the best I could until July... My question refers to the self diagnosis as an addict. I've kinda tried church working out trying to stay busy as possible and codependency as defenses. I've always come back to 12 step fellowships because I like aspects of the program &amp; the wide spectrum of personalities...From what I've heard in my time in the rooms my bottoms are high. At my best during my.addiction I (bearly) graduated Berklee College of Music played in bands have had a fun job as a teacher for the last 5 yrs. Never had been to jail and never "overdosed" to the point of hosptalization. I have been asked to resign at the end of school 3 out of the last 4 years I've taught. have been financially broke evicted from an apartment due to 911 calls from panic attacks I've had b/c with no food and and very little sleep. I tend to quit bc of $ or being scared of overdosing/dying of heart arrhythmia or something. When I use I try to use little amounts so I don't die but use up to 6 times a day (.1/.2 at a time) and at points not cared whether I lived or died though I'm still scared to. ..Am I an addict or just a hard user???..I go to 12 step meetings and do the work with a sponsor because I feel like it's the "right" thing to do but don't feel 100% bought in and I'm doing it bc I was living the wrong life with drugs. When I do the deal I try 2 do it so perfect &amp; 2 the best of my ability but I tend to overanalyze every aspect of my program &amp; detail of my life. Like I should do this or shouldn't do that because I'm in recovery/ living a new way of.Life. I have a difficulty connecting to others after meetings &amp; when I hear about people's bottoms my mind tells me I'm not addict but that I use addictive drugs but I almost always end up getting scared of death or just sick of needing to use that I say fuck using. When I do connect to people I tend to agree&amp;adapt myself to please them. I have ?s about sponsors &amp; get so many different opinions/feedback that Idk how 2 proceed &amp; what's right for.. .sorry this is so long. If u have anything 2 say even it's just "fuck off take this to another sub" or "fuck you just work the steps stop questioning it when it doesn't make everything perfect all the time.",3,6xdvvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6xdvvv/dillusional_ranting_and_a_question/,9,2017-09-01T07:19:48

oxygenvoyage,Accidentally consumed a little alcohol/had nightmares (vent),Vent: I'm a bartender and I worked a wedding the other day. I took a sip from the wrong cup and accidentally drank a little gin and didn't realize it til the aftertaste hit me.  I immediately stopped and I told someone in the program about it.  Then I carried on my shift. .So ...Last night I had the craziest nightmares about relapsing. It was so vivid. In my dream I glugged a huge cup of a cranberry screwdriver among other drinks and wasn't getting drunk..Let that be a lesson for me: even though I've been sober awhile I still got alcoholism.,11,6v5421,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6v5421/accidentally_consumed_a_little_alcoholhad/,3,2017-08-21T14:55:20

sji9273,The last time,As I sit here I have been telling myself that "this is my last drink" and "tomorrow is going to be my first day of sobriety"  ..I told myself that tomorrow I am quitting alcohol completely. Im sick of craving the next drop and impatiently waiting for when I can feel it's seducing warming effects again. It's effecting my marriage and also it's controlled my life for far too long. ..I have a glass in my hand and I'm literally looking into it thinking of how hard it is going to be. But at the same time a part of my brain is saying "Sal this is gonna be tough but we can do it" but I'm terrified of relapsing. I don't want to be that person. ..Even now contemplating sobriety all I want to do is get as fucked up as possible for one last hoorah. But I know that's the wrong answer.  But fucking Christ do I want to continue. ..I guess this is my very fond farewell my fellow redditors. I'm looking for a clearer path from now on. I look for your support and your guidance on this rough path.

I feel that I need to talk to him sooner or than later.

AmongOurFriends,Feeling awful 8 weeks into relapse,Hi all..34 year old male. First sobriety experience was in a "facility" which is very unique not impatient 30 day type not quite a sober living house. A middle ground so to speak. ..I got sober there and stayed sober for four years 2008-2012 before an acute onset of Crohn's Disease in my third year sober derailed me. It took about a year but I relapsed on pain killers. ..Stayed out battling Crohn's and taking painkillers along with the bottle until 2015 when I was able to go to a treatment center for two weeks and then straight to a sober living home. Then due to medications (prednisone oral chemotherapy immunomodulators etc) very heavy "medicines" I had to have a total hip replacement at 33 years old. I underestimated what the "non narcotic" tramadol would do to someone opiate naive. I relapsed again after 15 months sober. ..This past January was fortunate enough to go to treatment in Florida. I got sober the third time mid Jan 2016 and relapsed for literally no reason other than working a weak program 2 meetings a week stalling ok my fourth step etc. I put effort into other areas rather than focusing on recovery. Ran my first marathon was riding and doing 70-100 mile bike rides routinely. I found endurance athletics when I first got sober in 2008 at 25. ..Now here I am. Ebbing and flowing I was able to string together 5 days since I relapsed last. ..I am at wits end :/ it's my third major relapse since 2008 and they've all been progressively worse- this one headed that way if I am unable to right the ship. ..I am an alcoholic to the core- I drink heavily while active I am also a drug addict. Opiates benzodiazepines cocaine. ..I have an opportunity to move into a sober house with a few friends of whom I've known since 2008 and who have stayed sober since then. Great AA friends of mine true friends. The catch was I needed to be employed to move into this sober house. My current living situation is terrible with family- whom all use heavily mother father and younger brother. ..I got a job yesterday! A very humbling job delivering pizzas. Coming from someone who as a result of sobriety was a high voltage cable spliced for five years and then the director of continuing education at a law firm for two years. Relapse got me fired from both fantastic careers. ..Now here I sit. Trying to doctor myself using benzos and alcohol to get off opiates. Trying to "master plan" myself into sobriety. It is not working. In two weeks I went from taking 2mg Xanax a day which would have me feeling drunk or just pass out to yesterday taking 7mg of Xanax in a day. ..What a mess I've made. ..I know that if I can muster the few days clean to pass the urine test to move into the sober house I stand a VERY good chance of righting the ship and getting sober again. ..TL;DR - 3 major relapses two months into the third relapse. Unable to string together more than just a few days. Opportunity to move into sober living environment next week. I need help. I can't do this alone. ..New job schedule is working 5pm to 9pm daily- all of my go to meetings where I know everyone and feel at home I am unable to attend. ..I need help. ,2,6pp6ur,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6pp6ur/feeling_awful_8_weeks_into_relapse/,11,2017-07-26T12:26:32
ya-bitch-magnets,Shame and guilt after a relapse,It took everything I had to walk into a meeting after I had relapsed. "I won't take a chip" I thought to myself. "What will everyone think?". I had time I had a sponsee to whom I had just presented a chip to a week prior. I was doing everything that was asked of me. I had 2 homegroups was very active in service and giving back. When I was the speaker at meetings I would get called inspirational. ..But why was I doing it? I'm starting to think it was for recognition. I liked the attention I got from being the example. I guess my 4th step could have been more thorough. ..I'm a little all over the place right now. I've been to a few meetings since the relapse but haven't taken a chip. Today I was listening to a Macklemore song. These 2 lines near the end hit me:.."If I can be an example of getting sober.Then I can be an example of starting over."..That's it. I'm going to a meeting later today. I'm going to take a chip. Nobody will judge me. Nobody will think less of me. I'm proud of being part of AA and I'm not gonna let my ego take over me...I don't know why I'm posting this just maybe this could help 1 other person who's feeling shame right now. If there's a single place I know where you will not be judged it's Alcoholics Anonymous. ..Have a good 24 everyone,21,6pmn61,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6pmn61/shame_and_guilt_after_a_relapse/,18,2017-07-26T04:12:03
Smackinhoeserday,Has any recovered alcoholic successfully smoked weed without relapsing?,I know this is a controversial question but heres the truth. Im 23 years old and im 2 and a half years sober. Ive worked through the steps multiple times. Ive had my spiritual experience and am doing my best to live life on a spiritual basis. Lately i have considered smoking weed. Im not saying im going to do it i just want to know if anyone has ever recovered from alcohol and decided smoke some weed without realapsing. I personally dont see anything wrong with it. My main concern is that i dont want to drink. Ive lost the obsession to drink and i never want it back. My life is good tofay becuase of aa and the steps.

pineapplekid,Relapse,I was 2 days shy of 4 months of continuous sobriety. I hit the "fuck it" button and went on an eight day spree.  Thankfully my drinking was ruined by what I had learned in the rooms and 8 days of around the clock drinking was all I could take.  ..I am grateful for the members in AA. A week ago today I sent a message to a member saying I couldn't take it anymore.  Without hesitation they came to get me (even though I was drunk) took me out to dinner and let me talk. I think that's the single nicest thing anyone has ever done for me in my entire life. Thanks to her act of kindness I feel like I can do this sobriety thing and made it back into meetings...I've made it a week so far. My sleep is starting to come back to normal my nerves are settling and my head is clearing up. It does get better with every day I don't pick up a drink...Just thought I would share and wish you all a sober 2-4,17,6ol8z9,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6ol8z9/relapse/,11,2017-07-20T22:55:44
oallilviiseorni,Need help with relapsing roommate,So I need help. My roommate admitted to me that he's been drinking again. I've never dealt with his before and I'm completely lost. .Background he and I are not friends our families are semi close (it's why we are roomies) however he and I never were friends. We have been living together for roughly a month with everything going well. I knew beforehand that he was in recovery and was doing well with it. He is currently unemployed and I've been trying to help him find a job that he will thrive in. .I had a funny gut feeling the other day that he was drinking again and when he left the apartment I went into his room (you can yell at me later) and snooped around that's when I found all the empties. I calmly left his room and got ready for work. I was fully prepared to come home and talk with him. Talk no accuse just yak and show support. However when I got home he called me to his room and confesses what had been happening. .I was shocked!  We talked for a while about the struggle and I offered support and help. Offered to take him to AA meetings he seemed uninterested in that. .I did explain that I would not tolerate alcohol being drunk in the house (I'm not a recovering alcoholic FYI) and that if I found him drinking in the house I would bring this issue to his parents attention. .I'm totally out of my scope here and was looking for advice on this. Kicking him out I fear would do more harm than good. I'm just not sure if there are additional things I should be aware of or lookout for as I continue to live with him. .I figured it was a good sign that he admitted to me that he had relapsed? .Am I way off base with this? ..Thanks!! ,1,6okpcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6okpcf/need_help_with_relapsing_roommate/,2,2017-07-20T21:09:25

Truckytime,I'm going to get so much better here! :D and part of that is helping others! Here's a book recommendation.,Has anyone else read the book easy way to quit/control drinking by Allen Carr? Apparently it's the same book. I will say I haven't quite finished it yet but it works so long as you agree with him; his reasoning or can come up with your own reasoning..I don't know why he bashes AA in the book and I don't know why so many AA members talk about alcohol like it's something to miss out on... nobody's perfect. The key is to understand why you started drinking in excess. In the AA book I believe it's the main founders story Bill had his quitting revelation when a 'friend' suggested that he come up with his own solution to what he thinks of God to be..Don't quote me on that. My point is I quit smoking with meditation hypnosis and by replacing my addiction with something else (preferably positive/relaxing/fun or at least non destructive). I quit smoking so I could sing. And I'm healing quite nicely for 6 months now almost there. .I'm using all the same techniques for quitting drinking but if I haven't mentioned it yet there's good news it's so much easier! (Than quitting smoking.).Anyways good book good analogies in it for good tools to quit oh here's a kicker?!.How do you all deal with it in media? It's Everywhere! I can deal with signs... but movies radio songs... that's where the hypnosis comes in then I got an idea. My wife said brad pitt quit drinking. So I wondered who else and oh my god; john goodman samuel l jackson steven king?! Stevie ray vaughan; Besides whom i knew James Hetfield. These guys are my heroes! They act in movies and will continue to do so holding a glass of I don't know apple cider pretending it's whiskey. Or sing us songs about whiskey in a jar... or oh my goodness I've made the switch to country music and it's in like at least a third of the songs. .But if these celebrities can do it and remain strong so can I. I don't give a crap if they relapse. Everyone does... I did for years. 10 years I've been trying to quit smoking. Done. And I've only seriously tried to quit drinking once with zero intentions of ever drinking again. Last time I just thought I could cut back and it would be fine that was over 10 years ago... hey by the way did you know that most adults report a relapse within a decade or more. Most... if they can't do it your talking about millions of people then what makes me think I'm any different or stronger?.Take care fellas! .One more thing I forgot to add as a Strong tool to quit. I even did it to quit smoking. Drink anything else(safe beverage wise) and pretend your getting the same amount of relief from it. It actually works... and then after awhile you won't miss drinking. I like tea coconut water apple juice... I'm working out now so milk has a great amount of protein :D.Some hobby suggestions to help with the stress: play guitar (learning any new instrument helps immensely with health-memory mostly) harmonica (So easy to learn) and working out helps so much. Run if that's your thing (I don't) but the best part about working out is I'm giving myself 4 or more days rest and now that I'm over 30 I won't find much trouble gaining weight. Lol! Also I don't feel the same 'burn' as back when I did as a teenager. If you look up how to shock your muscles (not electrically...) to continue to make gains then make serious diet changes... I'm having fun just learning about all this great stuff I don't have time to drink! And that's another thing! Keep busy! You don't have to be a workaholic just find things you enjoy. I've tried thousands of hobbies and wasted thousands of dollars before I found stuff I liked. I also have the best excuse ever to refuse a beer now... no thanks I don't want to miss my gains. My goal is to look like chris evans from captain America and now that I've been unloading a full semi load a day average of 20000 pounds (thank god that's over) this ^ doesn't seem so hard. ,1,6mylp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6mylp5/im_going_to_get_so_much_better_here_d_and_part_of/,6,2017-07-12T21:57:10

quincystrick,Dry drunk,The Twelve Steps were right from the very start intended to start a new religion to give the followers "vital spiritual experiences" and to turn the followers into religious fanatics   "religiomaniacs". Bill Wilson believed that religious fanaticism was the only answer for alcoholism. Bill often misquoted "The only radical remedy for dipsomania is religiomania" (Bill attributed that quote to Carl Jung but Jung never said it. It came from page 263 of William James' book "The Varieties of Religious Experience".)..But what if you disagree with that message? What if you would prefer to keep the religious beliefs you already have? What if you choose to not believe in the Twelve Steps and since they are supposedly only a suggestion you freely choose to not do the "suggestions"? What if you just want to quit drinking without becoming a religious convert?..Well you can still join A.A. because the only official requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking but you won't really be a full-fledged member. The hard-core true believers have a deprecating name for such members: "One-steppers". People who only practice the first step admitting that they have lost control of their drinking. People who want to quit drinking and regain control of their lives but without all of the neurotic wallowing in guilt and grovelling before God that the other eleven steps entail. The true believers will tell you that you can't do that: you have to practice all twelve steps all of the time or you will relapse...When people do quit without the Twelve Steps and without even attending A.A. meetings the A.A. true believers will say that those people are not really "in recovery"; they are only "abstaining." What's the difference? Some counselors have lists of such differences like:...The A.A. true believers don't even ask about such differences they just automatically proclaim that anyone who doesn't drink and who also doesn't attend A.A. meetings is "only abstaining" while someone who is attending A.A. meetings and "doing the Steps" is of course "in recovery" whether they are actually working on any other issues or not...And the dogmatic believers will proclaim that the "abstainer" is not really enjoying a period of "sobriety" he is "only dry". To accomplish this twist in logic they bombastically redefine the word "sobriety" as:..SOBRIETY: A special state of Grace gained by working the Steps and maintaining absolute abstinence. It is characterized by feelings of Serenity and Gratitude. It is a state of living according to God's will not one's own. It is sanity...Even the word "sanity" is redefined there as Frank Buchman's sin-free "surrendered-to-God" (or surrendered-to-Frank) state of living   spending one's life "doing the will of God" as defined by the cult rather than "doing one's own will."..Likewise the true believers will say that the "abstainer" is a "dry drunk." "Dry drunk" is yet another imaginary disease invented by Alcoholics Anonymous. The term originally referred to a rather rare condition that some people have during the first months of recovery from alcohol abuse   they stumble around in an uncoordinated manner as if they are drunk even though they are 100% sober. But A.A. has turned it into a slur which is supposed to mean that someone is thinking and acting like a drunk man displaying all of the objectionable characteristics of an obnoxious drunk even though he is sober. And supposedly all sober men who won't do the Twelve Steps will suffer from that condition and will also become bitterly unhappy as well.....If an addict drops out of the Twelve Step system but remains totally abstinate from chemicals he is said to be a "dry drunk." He is not sober because sobriety requires the ongoing practice of Twelve Stepping. Some also refer to the state of being a dry drunk as "white knuckle sobriety" and believe that such a person is a veritable walking time bomb ready to descend with no warning precipitously into orgies of drunken oblivion unless he returns to practicing Twelve Stepdom..The Useful Lie by William L. Playfair M.D...On the other hand Paul Roasberry wrote in his essay The Cult Called A.A.:..Of course all cults have this in common: they reject and label as untouchables any who do not embrace their particular version of "Truth." To dyed-in-the-wool communists non-believers are "bootlickers of the capitalists" or "counter-revolutionary hooligans." To the born again fundamentalist Christian non-believers are "agents of Satan." To Moslems Christians are "devils" and to Nazis Jews are "swine." To the Alcoholics Anonymous membership anyone who stops drinking without chanting the mantras of cult founder Bill W. are "dry drunks" pure and simple. You don't even need to know anything more about the self-quitters   the fact that they quit drinking without A.A. makes them dry drunks a priori..The Cult Called A.A. Paul Roasberry..And unfortunately 12-Step true believers seem very reluctant to do a reality check there and compare their theories to actual results: If the A.A. member relapses while the so-called "abstainer" or "dry drunk" doesn't the A.A. fanatics will just blame their fellow A.A. member for "defects of character" and "constitutional incapability to be honest with himself" and for not practicing the Twelve Steps properly   for not "working a strong program" and perhaps for "holding something back in the Fifth Step"   while they simply ignore the nonmember abstainer or proclaim that "He'll still relapse it's just a matter of time." Under no conditions will the A.A. fanatics question the effectiveness of the A.A. Twelve Step program for actually quitting drinking and staying quit...,0,6ljj33,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6ljj33/dry_drunk/,25,2017-07-06T00:44:13
sji9273,So it happened,I've been going strong with no alcohol for a couple months now. Thought I could stop. But I came into a lot of negative things in my life and i relapsed. This is my first time relapsing and I feel like I'm never gonna be able to quit. All this shit in my life is fucking awful but liquor makes it all dissipate and vanish. ..I know I need to stay strong but I forgot how good this feels and I feel like I'll never be able to get ahold of my life.

I don't want to be this person but it's too easy to get a bottle from the store on my way home from work and finish it by the end of the night. ..As I'm writing this I'm polishing of a handle of Jameson and IPA.

throwitawaynow99989,A dilemma,Hey everyone throwaway for professional reasons...So I'm a medical professional. I'm under monitoring for work having come clean about my alcoholism. I never really took my program seriously (no step work no sponsor basically a 2.5 year dry drunk). I recently had a relapse went on a bender called in multiple days...Part of my program is random urine drug screening. I don't do drugs but it can detect booze for a few days after use. I've been chugging water think it's out of my system and been lucky with not being selected to pee...I have a few people I have to convince that all is well and that I'm good. I feel like I can do this. My concern is that when I really dedicate myself to my program and get to telling all the people how I've wronged them I'm afraid that if I tell people this I could potentially lose my license or other professional consequences. I want to make appropriate amends but I'm afraid that if I do I could lose my livelihood. I LOVE my job and am not sure what I would do without it...TL:DR. Want to be honest but afraid of losing my livelihood if I am...What should I do????..Thanks everyone...,3,6k60dl,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6k60dl/a_dilemma/,16,2017-06-29T00:19:44
babylina,yesterday at a conference was the most humbling experience.,i was on a host committee for a conference over the weekend and relapsed after a little over a year. i now have 4 days sober...when we host conferences the host committee is given out stuff to read up on stage in front of thousands of attendees. we get all dressed up and stand in front of hot lights and cameras. we have these people tell us they love us lots and lots and whole bunches. it's awesome...we also do a sobriety countdown. the person with the most time gives the 5 people with the least time big books that have been signed by all of the attendees at the conference...last night i should've been dressed to the nines reading the promises after the main speaker meeting. instead i looked like i had 3 days sober. and i stood up when they asked for my time. i started weeping. i was escorted to the stage and the host committee the same people that i thought absolutely hated me were clapping for me. they were hugging me loving on me welcoming me back. the gentleman asked me my name and how much time i had and when i looked out into the crowd i saw hundreds of people on their feet. and i looked into the crowd and saw some of my friends crying...i haven't felt god in a long time. i got raped recently and have blocked myself off from everyone around me. when i looked out into that room it's like i was broken open all over again. ..it was the most terrifying amazing needed feeling in the world. i came into AA with an ego. how? i dont know. but i did. and im happy. i feel different. i feel like that needed to happen to me yesterday. i am so grateful for alcoholics anonymous because it reminds me that i am absolutely not alone... ever. even when my thoughts have me totally convinced.,17,6fam5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6fam5d/yesterday_at_a_conference_was_the_most_humbling/,5,2017-06-04T19:38:57

psychedelicquestion,My dad has relapsed after about 4 months being home from rehab. Downing bottles of vodka what to do.,Like the title says. My dad is in a desparate state and is downing 750ml bottles of vodka. My mum wants to leave him (after fighting for him and the marriage for a very long time). We feel that if we leave him he'll probably kill himself. But we also have lives and can't take care of him constantly...The options are: mum leaves him and goes to stay somewhere else (very inconvenient for her) / mum kicks him out of the house (but what on earth will he do?)..Biggest concern is him killing himself if we leave him to his own devices...Any help from experienced people would be much appreciated.,3,6daux2,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6daux2/my_dad_has_relapsed_after_about_4_months_being/,22,2017-05-25T12:49:42
ThrowAwayNMDrunk,Sponsor Advice,I have had the same sponsor for about a year and a half maybe two years. This March completed three years that I have been in the program. Not to be confused that I have been sober this entire three years. I had a total of three sponsors before this guy. If I think about it really just one the other two were a couple old-timers I just talked to a couple of times never really got into step work... Well this current sponsor has stuck by me through my multiple relapses. Currently I honestly feel that I have no more chances. May 4th I did the same damn thing and went out binge drinking ended up driving my unit in a black out and THANK GOD I made it home. One time I crashed my fianc 's vehicle and ended up in rehab another time I actually totaled truck and got a DWI that Is currently still active. Yes this damn insanity I am out drunk driving while on trial for a DWI. But something is different this time. I have gone to a meeting every single day since. .After this last relapse or slip whatever you want to call it my sponsor told me to start the 90 in 90. ..About a year ago we were meeting twice a week and I was actually getting into some step work.  Well what I think was step work anyway  he had me doing some journaling. That only lasted about two months at the most so maybe a total of six meetings outside of our weekly AA meeting where we were alone ate dinner and talked and he read what I was writing. ..Now I just see him once a week at a meeting I drive about 45 minutes to. Now with this last relapse and going to all these meetings I really enjoy these meetings and I really want to start doing some step work. I want to the promises the big book talks about to come true in my life and I am eager to start working. But all he told me to do was the 90 in 90...Is this normal? I feel like I should be doing some type of step work or something with a pen and a paper. ..The meetings I have been going to everyday during my lunch hour I am thinking of reaching out to a few different people there but I don't know how I should stop going to my current sponsor or just have two or what I should do at this point...Any recommendations from anybody who has experience with this or anybody who has actually sponsored does this sound right? Do I stick with my current sponsor?..I cannot explain it but something is different this go-round every meeting I am eager to get to and by the time I am leaving I am ready to go to another one. I love everything I'm hearing The promises at the end of the meeting really really stick out to me now. I can't explain it all I know is that I honestly believe I am out of chances and the next time I drink will be very very bad therefore I can never EVER drink again!,3,6d7nvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6d7nvr/sponsor_advice/,33,2017-05-25T01:23:09
[deleted],i can't stand some people in AA. It makes me not want to go to meetings anymore.,For the most part AA has been good to me but lately I just can't stand some people..The lady who shares at every meeting the same tired story about her kids..The guy who constantly quotes big book pages he just seems so insincere and like a robot. .The old timer who says the disease is doing push ups in the parking lot..But mostly I can't stand the women they constantly whine about life and are so over dramatic..Also people who've been sober for years who constantly dwell on the past and war stories see people seem pathetic. .And there was one woman who hadn't had a drink in like 10 years and she reset her day count because she accidently had a sip of alcohol. What a stupid thing to do what is the point of resetting your day count she claims she relapsed. .Can anyone relate to me? ,18,6cqfuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6cqfuj/i_cant_stand_some_people_in_aa_it_makes_me_not/,68,2017-05-22T18:06:02
TrickyDickFlicks,How do you handle PAWS?,So this is my 4th time trying to get sober.  I'm finishing up a rehab program and have joined AA found a sponsor etc.  I know I'm making great progress and I'm almost a month sober but I feel like absolute dog shit.  One of the doctors at the rehab center told me it was post acute withdrawal syndrome (which explains why I've always relapsed in week 3 of my previous attempts at white-knuckle sobriety).  ..It's certainly nice to understand why I feel like I'm on the brink of madness every hour and then a zombie in the next but I don't really know what to do about it.  It doesn't help that I'm in the midsts of finals (I'm trying to finish my last semester from rehab) and I'm stressed and can't form coherent thoughts.  I feel stuck.  I don't have the time to do all the normal de-stressing tactics because I have to study but I can't study because I'm in PAWS.  ..Does anyone have any advice to get me through these next 8 days?  After that I can do all the self-care in the world.  ,5,6azmrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/6azmrk/how_do_you_handle_paws/,4,2017-05-13T15:22:16
saratoby,My sponsor relapsed.,I just hit my one year mark in February. My sponsor was the first person I spoke to in the first AA meeting I ever went to and she told me yesterday that she relapsed. She and kept apologizing for it but I'm not mad at her not even a little. I felt sad for her but relieved that she is alive and still willing to fight for her sobriety.  .  . But suddenly I feel lost like I've lost my anchor. It's like all the work we did together every personal thing I shared with her was all for nothing. And she's kind of the only person I really connected with in AA so I don't know how to talk about it with anyone else.  .   .She even talked about finding me a new sponsor. But what does that mean? Do I just start over? Do I tell this new person everything all over again? I told her I'd find one and not to worry to focus on her own recovery.  .  .I don't have the urge to pick up so I'm grateful for that miracle. ,17,69g53v,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/69g53v/my_sponsor_relapsed/,17,2017-05-05T13:35:16
the_eternalist,I hate somebody in the rooms,I've been around the rooms for quite a few years in many communities across the country as I've travelled with work. I've met incredible people and have always managed to see at least one good quality in individuals that I've met in the program who otherwise rubbed me the wrong way (including landlords who ripped me off other members who robbed me and a boss who wronged me) and I've managed to acknowledge my part in all these situations...There's a man in the program where I live now who I simply can't stand and he's made it clear that he doesn't like me either. He's considerably older than me and has a decade in. He's loud and obnoxious outwardly critical of other members and openly disrespectful. I've witnessed him pick fights and once even assault an elderly female member (which was of course stopped very quickly by a number of us). He's pointed fingers at me in meetings and openly criticized my program. We both attend a lot of meetings and it's making me increasingly uncomfortable; I've stated leaving early just to avoid him which I would normally never do. ..This individual is generally not respected in the community and I try not to join in when he's made the receiving end of jokes by other members. However inwardly I have a deep burning resentment towards him and it's effecting my recovery. I've tried being friendly I've tried ignoring him completely and I've prayed about it and for him. I've spoke to my sponsor and peers at length but I've got nowhere. In all honesty I've had sick thoughts of hoping he would relapse so that he would go away. It's beginning to effect my recovery...How do I deal with this? ,4,694k99,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/694k99/i_hate_somebody_in_the_rooms/,14,2017-05-03T21:13:39
YearZero44,90 days today.,Today marks 90 days of sobriety. This isn't the first time I've been here but hopefully my last 90 days. I just want to give a message to anyone else that is here been here or not quite here yet; being sober won't fix all your problems. What it will do is at least give you a chance to make a better life that you wouldn't otherwise have if you were still boozing or using. If you feel depressed lonely sad don't turn to substances to bandaid the fundamental issues in your life. Actually feel those emotions and make a plan to fix those problems. Go to meetings join a club get a hobby go to the gym and keep busy. Boredom and loneliness are the cause of most relapses in my opinion. Just keep busy and stay sober 24 hours at a time. ,25,66zfor,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/66zfor/90_days_today/,13,2017-04-22T20:36:47
saddrunkgirl,"Find other ways to deal with your issues",I don't know what to do. I feel incredibly hurt right now. I'm using my throwaway because reasons...Anyway I'm currently living in a country where being an alcoholic is very taboo. I was struggling - a lot. I was fortunate enough to find two other people in the program and we started meeting. I had a horrible weekend. I relapsed and made an awful mistake and have just been sick about it...Anyway after our meeting yesterday I got a message from one of my group members. (Here's where it becomes important to point out that I am a woman he is a married man. Nothing has ever happened between us. He has just been a great support system in a very lonely place and situation. In fact both of the other group members are married men but I am incredibly grateful to have fellow AAs man or woman.) ..The messages turned out to be from his wife. They read "I don't like you meeting with my husband. I saw you at [local bar] completely drunk. We were making fun of you and [random person]. I have no desire to have you around my family....please find other ways to deal with your issues."..There were some other messages but that was the gist of it. I messaged back and said I had no bad intentions with her husband and she should talk to him about it...I am so angry and hurt. I know "what others think of me is none of my business" but it's definitely hard. It's a reminder about my embarrassing actions when I was drinking and that other people remember (even when I don't). (Also no shit she saw me at a bar drunk. I'm an alcoholic.) It also makes me mad that she's so callous - like who is she to tell me to stop going to this AA group?..On the other hand I do understand her fear. I'm not a good person when I'm drinking. But I'm just incredibly hurt by what she said and I suppose on a deeper level just by the fact that I've continued to embarrass myself and make terrible mistakes when I drink no matter where I am in the world. I made a reputation for myself in less than a month. ..I told my AA friend I'd be happy to meet with her and I would. Honestly I was hoping to become friends with her before this happened. I need female friends who understand alcoholism/don't drink/will be okay with me not drinking. I hope she wants to meet with me and I do want to smooth this over. But the selfish egotistical part of me wants to blow up at her even though I know that a) won't help anything b) will only make be feel better in the short term and c) won't make her feel better because she's hurting too. ..I guess I'm just hurt embarrassed and also the selfish part of me is not feeling sympathetic even though I know trust issues are incredibly painful and difficult to deal with...Tl;dr: wife of a fellow AA says she doesn't want me around her husband and I need to find "other ways of dealing with my issues.",2,66f5gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/66f5gg/find_other_ways_to_deal_with_your_issues/,13,2017-04-19T23:12:14
bartmansheadphones,Lucid relapse dreaming???,Hey everyone..I'm pretty new to the AA program (a bit more than a month in).  I've been able to stay dry and am learning to be sober.  HOWEVER I have been having very lucid dreams many of which include a nasty relapse episode.  The last one involved 2 specific drugs I've had a less than savory relationship with and I woke up thinking I had used and actually felt a placebo high from.  My question is is this normal?  I was told by my sponsor and a few friends in the program that it is but I can't help but feel like a relapse is growing within me.,7,64uq7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/64uq7p/lucid_relapse_dreaming/,21,2017-04-11T20:01:07
mordo212,Almost a year sober and exciting new lows,Hi as the title says I have just short of 11 sober and for a while things did get better. I was diagnosed bi polar got put on meds that stabilized me. Had my best friend come. Back into my life. I find out she has terminal cancer. Well at least I have time left with her. Since then I got out of a halfway house and moved home. Still going in the right direction right...Fast forward to one month ago . I get home from dropping my friend off at her boyfriends house that is two hours she has been staying with me a bunch when she is getting treatment. away and go to bed. I wake up and notice my cell phone is shut off. I am not good at paying bills even when I have money. So I bust out my debit card and go to pay my bill. Declined OK fat fingered it declined declined. Color me confused I have thousands in the bank. So I head to my bank to see what's up. All my money is gone. Every last penny gone. I start freaking out and having a panic attack. I back into someone at the bank. Thankfully only damage to my car. This is the high point of my day by the way. I go to call my friend as she pretty much my non Healthcare related support system. No answer eh she sleeps a ton from chemo. Next day J hear from the bank and all the transactions are atm withdrawals at the branch down the street from my house. Then it hits me. She hasn't been anwsering calls because she stole all the money...My world starts collapsing around me. So I start with the bank on what needs to be done. Step one sigh. Police report. Step two fraud cases. Step three agree to prosecute my dying best friend. This is where I start to really struggle bad. I have all kinds of family members telling me I am stupid for trusting her and have to hate her. My therapist and psychiatrist take a more gentle approach and don't accuse me of being stupid. My sponsor is somewhere in between...Worst thing of all I don't know of any way to deal with this. I keep going to my AA meetings and start hanging around my old. Halfway house as I am unemployed. My depression and rage are getting worse. And the swings between them are happening very rapidly. I start flipping out at people at meetings. My psychiatrist changes up my dosages...All this while I have been job hunting as it's a condition of me being able to live at home. I've been looking for almost 4 months for a job in my career field. No luck finding anything. I start having really dark moments. I can't peel myself out of bed some days other times I can't sleep for days at a time. I start thinking of checking myself into a psych unit for a check up. Of course a company calls and wants to do an interview. I do the phone interview. Next day come on in for a interview. I go in and for once nail an interview. Two days later lunch with the company president. Great he wants to drink with lunch. Yeah I'll be like oh hey I'm a vicious heinous alcoholic. Oh and I'm also bipolar who just had his best friend rip his heart out and rob him blind. I manage to not drink and let him think I don't have a problem...They higher me. I was hoping they wouldn't because my mental state is spiraling further down by the day. So I start work and the job is going well enough...I have gone against advice of family other friends my sponsor and Healthcare pros. I have been trying to reach out to talk to the person who stole from me to support an old opiate habit that relapsed once the prescription pain meds started. She won't talk to me at all. This is the most painful thing of all. Fuck the money I want smalls back. I finally managed to get her on the phone and text for about 10 minutes. And I quote..Her " I'm done..giving up..so I don't need it. And I'm sorry...."..Me" So am I. What hurt more than the most was losing my best friend "..Her" Well I'll be a distant memory in a few days...i did love u..plz stop I'm not worth anything and can't handle life..like I said I'm done .take care and be good to urself u deserve the best and ur capable and strong..take care my old friend...till we meet again"..I am scared. I don't have my best friend. I'm starting a new job and am going to be without health insurance for 3 months. I am scared I may start having more dangerous thoughts and if I bail on my first good paying job in years well I'm fucked on that.

s15rballard,I need suggestions...,Hello I'm a 20 year old college student and I need serious help. I'll give you all the facts as follows. . mom (52) is a longtime alcoholic. I am in my fourth and final semester of community college.. during my first and second semesters mom drank heavily. . In the second semester I needed to protect myself from being affected by mom I threatened to stop talking to her and blocked her on social media.. during my third semester mom had a small but severe relapse which culminated in her living in a friend's house without her permission (she was a state away and had trusted mom to feed her cats).. it was during this relapse that she had tried to fake test result sheets from a reliable drug testing service. I noticed that something was off and got a note from the testing center that the sheets had been doctored. Needless to say  I was furious.. I was not talking to mom at this point and once she returned home dad pressured me to start talking to her. He basically had to force me and there is still some discomfort talking to her.. a few months ago she found out one of my most personal secrets and I explained that I couldn't trust her with that information unless I was totally confident she was reliable and that if it leaked I would have to ensure that I was safe.. I got home from a long distance hiking trip with the college today and mom instantly asked me about adding her on facebook. Having sat in a bus for seven hours straight I can't say I was too polite in telling her (again) it's not something I'm comfortable doing yet. . she walked into her room and came out acting oddly. . I asked her if she had been drinking  she said no.  .I asked her if she would be okay taking a portable BAC test. She said she would. . she lacked sufficient coordination to blow for enough time for the machine to measure her BAC. . with dad's help she blew twice the legal limit.  ..In short  we've tried to keep her  we've tried to get her to take care of herself but her condition is hurting me and I'm at a point in life where I'm more vulnerable than I'd like to be. Any advice? ..TLDR; How to succeed in college with manipulative alcoholic mother? ,2,60lmpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/60lmpf/i_need_suggestions/,11,2017-03-21T00:34:01
RecipeForIceCubes,A healthy reminder.,This is just a healthy reminder that no one no matter how many hours days weeks months years or decades of sobriety we have that all are susceptible to alcohol's power at any time.  An old friend from AA (Dan for this anecdote) whom I've known for years and had not seen in some time was at a meeting last night that I happened to be chairing for my wife.  I asked if anyone would like to be recognized for any period of sobriety and shockingly (Dan) said 24 hours.  ..This gentleman who filled my early years with unmatched wisdom and who had 26 years of sobriety up until sometime Thursday had relapsed.  There was no gasp from the group and he was not looking for sympathy.  (Dan) made the right choice to come back and knew he would be welcomed at this meeting where no judgments would be passed and he could be propped up in a trusted environment of hope and strength.  ..I will never forget this meeting and what (Dan) had to communicate to those attending that no matter how much sober time we have put behind us that it will never be more than one day of challenges and triumphs ahead.  Our best days are all yet to come.  Thank you for being here for me and for each other.,17,5xht6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/5xht6d/a_healthy_reminder/,3,2017-03-04T11:56:36
soburry,Do we do introductions here? I'm Soburry and I'm an alcoholic., I wanted to do an intro post to force myself to become more active in an online AA forum. I used to be an active member of a different AA forum and I loved it. I relapsed and when I went back 1.5 years later it just wasn't the same...A bit about me. I've got 205 days sober. I went to rehab in August which was a 12 step program. After I left I did 90 in 90 got a home group got a sponsor. I attend the same 2 meetings every week and sometimes pick up an extra one if I have time. I do commitments such as set up coffee greeting. I'm currently working on Step 4 with my sponsor. Both of my regular meetings are big book study groups. I've read the first 164 pages a few times and working through the stories...I'm finding as the time goes on I want to drink more and more. This past month has been particularly hard because I have had my house to myself as my parents are traveling. Being alone is a massive trigger for me as there was nothing better than being able to get as drunk as I wanted without having to hide it from anyone. I love my job but I spend my days daydreaming about leaving mid day and going on a 2 week bender. I am more jealous of normal drinkers than I've ever been before. I wish I was a normal drinker so I could drink all the time...I'm also worried that I don't really like AA. Everyone talks about how they never felt like they belonged anywhere so they turned to drinking to help them fit in and since they've found AA they feel like they belong somewhere now and don't need to drink to get the feeling of belonging. I dont feel that way at all. I have been going to same meetings every week for 6 months I know everyone there I have some AA friends but I still feel super disconnected and like I'm on the outside. I also have no interest in reading the book praying believing in a higher power etc. I feel like I'm just lying all the time in AA...I have a LOT of good in my life but my thinking is so negative all the time I don't feel grateful for anything. I need to change my thinking first and foremost...Anyway thats me! I hope to be an active member of the community. I need to form connections.

My 4th year is coming up in 5 days...I'm sharing here because I'm in a frustrating place. Please don't scold or lecture me in just looking for support...Just since like ~2 weeks ago I've been having strong relapse dreams: sometimes I'm not an addict sometimes I'm distraught by a relapse but sometimes I just don't care. I know I can't control my dreams but it's effecting me...And my thoughts have been fine- up until yesterday really. I have strong feelings of wanting to party. I'm 23 in my last semester back in school and finally feeling like a "normal college kid" again (meaning I have a bunch of tight knit friends I'm back active in my sorority - I'm just fitting in really well and really happy). But my brain rationalized paying as "it's your last semester light load just binge for the semester and get it together after." ..It's just really frustrating and I wanted to tell someone but I don't want to freak out my family or best friends. I'm not very active in AA anymore (again this is a personal preference - please do not scold me on this. I am a firm believer in the 12 steps and they - along with meetings - saved my life. So I love and appreciate AA but I'm just no longer super active. I also believe in recovery having the goal to return to a normal life and through the help of AA I have done just that.)..Edit: WOW!!! Thank you all so much for the positivity. I am working through the comments now. But just know: 1) thank you 2) I appreciate it more than you know..,9,5t72dw,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/5t72dw/support_4y_clean_having_relapse_wishes_disease_in/,19,2017-02-10T07:44:12
buffalo_bill_cosby,Finding a meeting,Ive made the decision to start going to meetings.  I just relapsed after my dad had a heart attack and really just freaked out.  Sad excuse if you ask me.  He's doing fine now but now all I can think about if why the HELL did I do that? I was a month sober without any meetings- yet I can't just jump to the bottle when something bad happens.  My question is : what's the first step in finding a meeting? I can look online and type in "AA meeting" easy.  But there's literally so many.  How the hell to i choose one? What if I go to one and see someone I know? How fucking embarrassing.

erinboy,Disruptive relapser at AA meeting.,A couple of times a month a lady shows up at our small bigbook meeting. She was sober for a short time last year. Now she turns up drunk and disruptive. She goads people about drink constantly interrupts people when they are sharing and insults people. What can we as a group do? Should we let her monopolise the meeting when she wants? Kick her out? We have tried reasoning with her but it falls on deaf (and drunk) ears. Any experience with this would be very welcome. ..Ed: Staring? It should be sharing. ,1,5q2cgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/5q2cgi/disruptive_relapser_at_aa_meeting/,15,2017-01-25T04:43:13
neurorhythmic,My sponsee just died,Of course I had to find out through cryptic facebook posts...I'd been sponsoring this guy for the last couple of years on and off. He disappeared a few months ago after a bad relapse when I had to take him to the hospital. Sat and talked with him one more time after that. I tried to get him to come back. He did but only for a few weeks....I'm heartbroken. I loved the guy like he was family...I called my sponsor as soon as I found out. He reminded me to pray and meditate and do my nightly review. He reminded me to keep trying to get closer to knowing God's will for me and ask for the power to carry it out. He told me to go talk to newcomers at my home group. That sounds like the right thing to do but it's a painful thought...It's so hard right now. I want to be angry. I want to cry. I want to call him and keep remembering that I can't...I feel so lost. I don't have any obsession to drink. I'm just questioning myself. I really feel like I gave him everything I had. I know that no human power could have saved him. My mind is just racing...I love you guys. I'm so grateful for the fellowship.,9,5q1glb,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/5q1glb/my_sponsee_just_died/,10,2017-01-25T00:26:57
Treesho,3 months sober but I feel a relapse closing in...,I drink to escape from myself. Lately my depression has waned; however just this week it's come back quite fiercely. I feel utterly useless and life feels pointless. I take no interest or pleasure in anything. These are the perfect conditions for me to drink so I can feel something. They're also the perfect conditions for suicide but there are other subs for that. ..My sponsor and I are just starting the 4th step and he assures me working through this and always remembering and strengthening my hold on the 3rd step will help alleviate my issues; however I'm not sure.

[deleted],Relapsed. Please help.,After nearly 5 years of consecutive sobriety I have relapsed for about a month now. Opiates and cocaine so I will have withdraws when I stop. But that's the least of my worries. If my wife finds out she will leave me. She has said it in the past. And she will take our 2 year old son with her. He's my world and I cannot stand to lose either of them. ..Is it wrong of me to go through withdraws and just never tell her or my family?

tremonee,Has anyone here had avascular necrosis? Hip pain?,So a little background I am a 32 year old male and been drinking heavy since I was about 19 went to rehab two separate times in the last year the latest time being last march. While at that treatment I was playing basketball and felt a pop in my hip/groin and had severe pain shoot down my right leg. I then relapsed after leaving the treatment center and lost my insurance and just got it back at the beginning of January and have been sober off and on. I finally got to the doctor today and found out I have avascular necrosis which means I have had a lack of blood flow to my joints mainly my right hip and it has caused the bone to detoriate. The doctor  said it was caused by excessive alcohol abuse and my only option is a hip replacement or to live in severe pain. Just kind of a shock that I could of done that much damage only being 32 just wondering if anyone has been through this??

My sponsor continues to warn me that until I learn steps I'm in danger of relapse but I'm almost 7 months sober and feeling fine. I also wouldn't classify myself as a compulsive drinker. I drink too much yes. But I'm a high functioning high bottom alcoholic. I've never drank myself out of home employment family. I'm not kidding myself I'm finished with alcohol.

Ok days off I smile morning noon and night.  ..Over the last year I have got gotten drunk 3-4 times in events related to my wedding.  ..I don't feel in danger of immediately relapsing into daily/weekly drinking but I do I see myself slowly getting back into it.  ..My daily pot use and lowering of my guard for drinking scares me because my first child was just born.  ..I went to a meeting last week but it felt weird because I've only drank like 5 times over the last 5 years. ..But I want to curb my daily intoxication (marijuana)..Is AA for me?

Stinker_Bell_77,AA isn't working for me.,So I was court mandated to go to AA. First year and a half was pretty bad considering I couldn't and didn't want to stay sober. I spent that first year and a half in and out of jail for relapsing. Finally I went on to a long term treatment facility in Arizona. This treatment center was in the middle of the goddamn desert. At first I was psyched to have a brand new start. I was excited to make new friends and begin a new life. .Well that gung-ho attitude soon disappeared. The rehab itself was abusive to the extreme if you didn't comply with their rules. Now I'm all for obeying rules and regulations. However I had a terrible experience at this rehab. I quite literally got into trouble nearly every single day while I was there. And a lot of the time it was over really trivial shit. Now I'm not a bitch to people unless they give me a reason to be. And if you put 24 newly sober girls under one roof chances are it won't necessarily be a pleasant experience. But these girls were downright rude and obnoxious. And if I were to stand up for myself and tell these idiots to fuck off I'D be the one getting in trouble. .Now I am in no way trying to play the victim here. But I fucking hated Arizona with every fiber of my being. And I especially loathed that fucking rehab and everyone in it. As soon as I could leave I did. I moved back home and started attending AA again. .Fast forward to me being dry for 4&1/2 years and I'm contemplating suicide and literally have no desire to work the program. I'm an atheist. I don't believe in god and I never will. And the more people try to shove their AA nonsense down my throat the closer I am to telling them to go shove a truck up their ass. Yes I know I sound extremely angry. And ya know what? I am. I gave myself to AA for nearly 6 years and honestly it didn't do anything but make things worse for me. .I know that AA is NOT a hot bed of mental health. But the severity of how fucked up people are to others blows my mind. I'm not perfect. Not anywhere close. And I've been known to be a total bitch to those who don't deserve it. I'm not proud of it. But I went back to AA to get sober and happy not angry and bitter and thinking suicide would be the best solution than anything else. .I don't find AA to be helpful. I don't trust anyone in that god forsaken program. Granted I had a horrible upbringing and that certainly didn't help matters. I've also tried SMART recovery and other ways to stay sober. I'm going to therapy twice a week. I think I'm gonna try creative recovery. I need help.,9,5kb4pm,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/5kb4pm/aa_isnt_working_for_me/,30,2016-12-25T19:55:45
CORROSIVEsprings,Relapse after first sobriety,Prior to getting clean I was an alcoholic and also a drug addict doing mostly Percocet and xanax. Went to detox and managed to find my way to a faith-based sober living facility in south Florida. (Coming from hometown in MA). I was doing great. At 19 years old managed to get 6 1/2 months clean. Went through to step 11 had a sponser homegroup relationship with my God all the good stuff... but why? I went home to follow up on a court date and to attend my brother wedding. Why did I stop working my program as soon as I got home? Lost my sobriety for a horrible 2 day run. My sponsor suggests I got a case of the fuck it's. I believe it had to do with reservations. Has anybody else been in a similar situation? What advice do you give for leaving my now "comfort zone" (halfway in Sofla) in the future. What can I do to prevent future relapse.

wolfmanhuck,I'm scared to fail and don't know what to do...,I've been debating AA for over a year. I can go a few days without a drink. Apparently 5 days right now. It has worked out because I can hide it as weekend drinking. The fact is once I start drinking all my worries go away. Those worries tend to be money. They don't actually go away of course. Part of the issue is when I'm drunk I blow money like it's going out of style. I'm now thousands of dollars in debt. A lot of that has gone to the bar actually the majority including a credit line increase. .The other problem is I know drinking is a major cause of my depression and anxiety. Earlier this year I went 50 days without drinking. I was in tears a few days but I was able to hide it from people because I worked nights and I won't drink before work. Towards the end of the 50 days my depression and anxiety disappeared. It was a very strange feeling to me but good at the same time. For once I wasn't paranoid. I didn't think my closest friends and family despised me. Also I'm into weight lifting and I lost a lot of fat and looked pretty good. Since those 50 days ended I've drank every weekend. .I'm scared to go to AA and fail or relapse. I'm scared to live my life without alcohol. I don't know how I can be social. I'm very introverted. I feel like my life would be better but I've almost been waiting for someone to tell me I need help. It got to the point I wished for a DUI so I would have to go to AA. (I know that's seriously messed up and wrong)..The only thing that has been able to keep me away from drinking is weight lifting but overtime the drinking wins out on the weekends. 4 different tests told me I need help. Hell maybe I just needed to say all this. Maybe I really do need help..,2,5gef5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/5gef5i/im_scared_to_fail_and_dont_know_what_to_do/,7,2016-12-04T02:35:15
yogurtLover2,How can I help him?,Not sure if it belongs here but my ldr boyfriend suffers from alcoholism. He attends AA meetings and has being doing so for almost 3 months now it has been hard since he relapses and drinks. The longest he went without drinking was around 3 months. ..He at the same time gave up tabacco he no longers craves for smoking but alcohol still gets him. ..We talk everyday and he even knows he has a problem and he wants to fix it  he is so hopeless because he thinks it is a disease it will not be taken out of him...We are in a long distance relationship and when I visited him I saw his dark side that I never want to see in my life. He knows this and since I will see him soon he has tried changing this horrible habit. He means well he tries his best to stay away but it just the cravings to the alcohol that gets hold back. ..I made a mistake by "being the mom" constantly telling him he shouldn't when I find out he drank and me getting mad but that just made him hide things from me. ..I am now trying to just hear him out and reminded him of the things he made me go through when we were together. What can I do? .He has so much potential he really wants to get rid of this problem. ..He is a software engineer but he right now hasn't found a job and is in customer service. I know he wishes to be in a better job and then he gets depressed..What can I do as his girlfriend and as long distance partner?,3,5eytk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/5eytk3/how_can_i_help_him/,11,2016-11-26T04:49:50

But after one week I ended up at [local dive bar]...This always resulted in hearty laughter. ..I'm not understanding the truth behind this that makes it funny.

aquawriter72,Honesty is the best policy?,So I had dinner with a good friend of mine over the weekend.  He used to be my sponsor but he has relapsed on crystal meth and crack.  Now I am there for HIM as he has been for me.  I truly do not understand about drug addictions like the ones he has been dealing with.  Alcohol has always been my vice and I have not had a drop in over 10 months.  I feel like I am doing pretty good in spite of the stress in my life right now.  I am dealing with what we in AA call some "real life shit." I won't go into it but it involves family health issues and a close friend who's dying of cancer and in his final weeks..Now over the weekend my former sponsor and current friend point blank asked me if I smoked marijuana the other night.  He had suspected that is what I'd gone to do because he knows my history with this person.  I didn't want to lie to him so I told him that yes I had.  I do not live in a state where it is legal for recreational purposes.  However I do read and I keep up with the medical research so I know there are many benefits of marijuana.  I recently bought a vaporizer and I vape weed maybe twice a month at home.  I don't go out and party after most of the time I just go to bed or fall asleep on the couch.  Boring right?  Well I am using it to deal with some major depression anxiety and panic attacks.  I have to say too that it has brought down my anxiety tremendously.  Am I self medicating yes.  Why? Because anxiety is not listed as a diagnosis that is covered in my state..I plan on continuing to use marijuana for anxiety and I still plan on going to my home group AA meetings.  I feel like they both are helping me tremendously.  I know a lot of people (if they knew) would say that I need to start my day count over which is not going to happen.  Do you think it is okay to just leave this part out with my AA peers?  I go to meetings because "the only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking."  If pot was a problem for me and I was abusing it then I think I should start my day count over.  What do you think?  I need some advice here.  I will tell you that I am not starting my day count over.  If this makes people in my meetings angry and pushes me away I am likely to go drink again.  If I drink again it may kill me this time.  I need your advice but please be kind.  If people start pushing me out the doors of AA it is going to be a dangerous slippery slope for me.,5,5buqcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/5buqcr/honesty_is_the_best_policy/,17,2016-11-08T12:53:02
allie-rva,5 years sober here I have a question for y'all,So my husband relapsed and came back to the rooms over the summer. He has three months again. It's been really difficult finding our footing through this. He is struggling with his higher power and disliking having to "have to do" certain things in order to stay sober. I asked him if it was the praying the step work the meetings that he disliked.... he doesn't know. ..I said "well it's better than using right? Or would you rather be doing that?" He said of course he'd rather be drunk and high everyday.... I got upset so he added "without consequence just like any other alcoholic or addict."..I told him I would really not want to drink again even if I had impunity. It was fun in the beginning but I can't even hypothetically say yeah I wanna drink like a normal drinker. Why? I drank until oblivion every time.

cweaver8518,Wife fell off the wagon again...,Guess I just need to vent. Wife has struggled with alcoholism for years but she had been clean for 3+ years. She has suffered through depression and anxiety for years before alcoholism as well and had recently switched her anti depressant medication. This was Tuesday of last week. I was away visiting my ailing grandfather who lives in a different state and I suspected something odd then. Tuesday Wednesday Thursday our phone conversations get shorter and shorter which is odd because she's super chatty on the phone normally and I have to tell her goodbye about 30 times before she can actually hang up. ..Confronted her on Thursday on the phone about it she says it's the new meds. I'm inclined to believe her because she had gastric bypass surgery back in 2009 and ever since then her medication absorption is finicky. This wouldn't be the first time she had had a medication do something weird to her. A different medication once caused seizures(it was a known side effect but extremely rare. So much so that it wasn't listed and the pharmacist had to dig to find the warning of possible seizures in the side effect list cause he had never seen it happen for this particular med). ..Anyway I tell her to stop taking that med cause it's turning her into a zombie. Friday she's "tired" all day and slurring her words not a drunken slur but a genuine tired slur. I suspect the meds hadn't cleared out of her system yet. Saturday I fly back home she picks me up from the airport and she's still "tired" and has me drive home. She starts nodding off at her desk I take her to bed thinking long day long week first time I've been away from home for awhile and she had 3 kids tiring her out. Sunday: same thing. ..Tonight I went to bed early and she stumbles into the bedroom and lays sideways across the bed pushing me cause I had accidentally draped myself over her side of the bed. I moved and she laid down upside down on the bed and diagonally. I get up to go to the bathroom since she had woken me up and she was acting way more "tired" than the previous nights. Words incoherent and slurred. I ask if she's been drinking again. Her reply: "a bit"..I get up and dig around the house found a fifth of Grey Goose damn near drained. Dig through the trash found various bottles of alcohol everywhere. Vodka and wine are her drinks of choice. She had to have been drinking for a week and I should have known. ..This is a danger to our kids. I can't take this shit anymore. Every time it happens I think about what this does to our kids and I don't know that I can keep taking this risk even if she's been clean for awhile before this a small trigger and she's what driving my 3 year old to daycare drunk? Sleeping all day while I'm at work? Sneaking around alcohol and lying about it? Is there a support group for husbands of alcoholics? I'm just lost I don't even know what to do anymore   ..Edit: I'm not an alcoholic nor have I ever been. I had previously drank with her but it was rare/recreational and sparse and wasn't an alcoholism problem until after she had her gastric bypass surgery and lost a ton of weight then she drank to blackout multiple times. We confronted her alcoholism / wine obsession and never stored alcohol in the house afterwards but it took years of there being a problem and us denying that she was an alcoholic relapses here and there then a few more relapses under the guise of "I can control it" or allowing her only to drink with me or whatever other excuse myself or she could come up with until the last relapse where we swore to never do it again.,7,51dwop,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/51dwop/wife_fell_off_the_wagon_again/,6,2016-09-06T02:31:52

Never strung together more than 100 days- I lied about being sober came to meetings high praying nobody would look at my pinpoint pupils shrugging off dinner plans and regular phone calls...My last relapse took me to the very fringes of sanity. I was dating someone else's girlfriend. Every friend (at least the ones whom I tried to stay in touch with) kept me at arm's length and didn't believe a word I said. ..I was a liar and a charlatan.

"Are you ok???" because I was hiding. ..Sometimes real life is too bright the high wattage bulbs of public and social scrutiny make me want to call an Uber cop go home and crawl into bed. The idea that my actions have consequences was too real for me- I understood that concept abstractly but truly? I never held myself responsible. ..AA tells me that I'm not a bad guy- that my patterns of behavior stem from character defects. The same defects I tried blotting out with heroin and amphetamine. Personally I am skeptical...I'm about 95% done with my 4th step. Everything's organized in a binder with tabs and sections. Would be done sooner but my sponsor is overseas for work until next Thursday. ..So here I am armed with an entire novel on my resentments fears sex life and many many harms. It's terrible writing the biography of a complete asshole. My mind races- will I ever stop doing these things?..I violated so many boundaries of trust stepped on friendships and people I loved. Some are very powerful people who could ruin my life. Every day I live steeped in shame not wanting to get out of bed and pretend all of a sudden I'm a good person...Who else steals lies and cheats people they love? Over and over and over. A sociopath?.."What a cute sob story" you must be thinking. "He's spiritually sick he needs to do his 5th step" maybe. ..I know that time takes time. .I know that these feelings are natural..I know I can't do a thing about them...But fuck me....Anyway hi! I really like this sub....A...,2,4zpk8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/4zpk8p/82_days_young/,6,2016-08-26T12:44:58
Oh3,8 years to relapse.,I finally did it.  Probably planning it for years.  A "good" reason came up and I did it.  Quit drinking April 1 2008.  I was back in the same town where I had my last drink 8 years ago for a rock show.  I pissed my girlfriend off over a stupid nothing that was my fault and she left.  I went down stairs walked past the free wine looked back walked over and had one.  I said to myself I'm getting fucked up tonight."..Went to the show by myself made some fast friends.  Fast forward 10 hours.  Spent $500 on alcohol for me and my "friends" probably had about 12-15 drinks after 8 years abstaining.  Coke and weed busted out on my hotel desk which I have a faint memory of doing and some hanger-on dude sleeping in the chair of my room.  Me still drunk with remorse setting in more every hour as the drunk wears off...It took one night hell less than 12 hours to do ALL of the fucked up shit I did to get me to stop drinking.  I'm a professional now thanks to sobriety.  I risked my livelihood my relationships my whole new identity for one night...So - I cleaned everything up got rid of the guy in my room as politely as possible in case he has pictures and I made my escape.  I called my girlfriend who is sober on the ride home and confessed everything that may or may not be over...Here I am a newcomer again.  Sobriety date of Aug. 14 2016...So there's supposed to be a lesson in this.  I will never be cured.  Over the years I forgot why I quit and convinced myself that I could be different.  There is a version of me that is violent impulsive and self-destructive and the key to his cage is the first drink.  if he gets out again there's a good chance he will take me to prison with him...,27,4y2jqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/4y2jqs/8_years_to_relapse/,16,2016-08-16T19:29:49

allie-rva,Alcoholic married to alcoholic,This is my first time in recovery. I have five years and some change and I'm 27. My husband is now 39 and he had a few goes at sobriety but I never knew the side of him that drank or used. His sober date was 8/6/2010. When we got married of course I thought about my vows in sickness and in health good and bad all of that but I honestly thought deep down it would always be sober and sober. I trusted him 100% come to find out first weekend in June that he's been relapsed on pills....found out later it's been for two years almost our whole marriage. ..It's been a really rough two months since finding out. He went to detox for a week slipped and has been using until about two weeks ago he went to treatment and I'm really proud of him for making that decision. ..The crazy part is dealing with my disease. I know I have no power. I know this. I know I didn't cause it and I can't fix it. But it's like all of that doesn't make sense anymore when it's the person I love most. And yeah I know it makes the family sick too...I have a lot of guilt and fear. I can't believe I was so blind to it but I guess my higher power knew I wasn't ready to see it. I know I should get myself to Al Anon. ..I was grateful to be an alcoholic bc there's a solution. But now I'm so bitter at the disease again. Cuz I know that my husband might not get this and I have to accept that he could die.

Imseventhirty,Less than a month of sobriety and dealing with depression.,First of all I go to doctor for my depression this a medical condition. And sometimes depression discourages me from working the steps and speaking and doing AA because I feel like I won't feel better anyway so what's the point. ..But I'm going to continue living the steps and although I'm early in recovery I had 4 years and relapsed.

Imseventhirty,Been irritated during meetings lately,I only have a few weeks sober been sober before with aa for years but relapsed. Lately the people in some of the meetings irritate me when they share. This one woman shares and it almost sounds as if she's bragging she shares how she has full acceptance works the steps calls her sponsor everyday but she shares in a way that is so irritating as if she's the mother Teresa of sobriety. Other people irritate me they share the same crap over and over and just annoy me. Is this normal for me? I really can't stand certain people in AA and want to put earplugs on when they share. It all so corny sounding people like its a rehearsed share. I can't help it if I feel this way but I do can anyone else relate?..Also the stupid slogans that don't coincide with the big book. Like if you don't remember your last drink you probly haven't had it" yes I don't remember my last drink the big book tells me I won't too...I'm just tired of sitting in a room and hearing people spout one liners don't these people read the book.  .I llike speaker meetings where I can listen to people's experience strength and hope.,11,4uadzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/4uadzl/been_irritated_during_meetings_lately/,29,2016-07-23T18:18:13
dawnmickseanold,What do you think of people who use steroids in recovery?,Hey guys I'd like as many opinions as we can get here. What do you think about people who use steroids in recovery? I will give you a past experience of mine...Around 6 months sober I chose to start a cycle of steroids. I'm not going to try to justify why I did or if I think it changed my behavior. I wanted to look good and it's sneaky behavior no argument to it. I confessed to my sponsor while working the steps and was afraid of what he would say. He told me it would be smart to stop immediately which I had already finished taking steroids. I asked him if this counts as a relapse or a slip. He asked me my intentions. I told him how I felt I wanted to look good and I didn't like how I looked since I had always been so skinny. He told me he didn't believe I had to reset the date however it is very common that when an addict uses steroids a relapse typically follows afterwards. When my sponsor moved away and I got a new sponsor I had confessed this too him as well. This new sponsor I have is an old timer and he claimed the same opinion. I'm approaching 2 years sober now. I have heard so many different opinions on this subject and obviously I've heard the opinions of people who have sponsored me. What do you guys think? Give me your opinion good or bad with an explanation if you wish..,1,4sr07p,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/4sr07p/what_do_you_think_of_people_who_use_steroids_in/,10,2016-07-13T22:42:56

janewolf,Kombucha and AA?,I'm Jane and I'm an alcoholic...I have recently become infatuated with kombucha. As a recovering alcoholic part of the struggle is finding something that tastes good to drink that isn't water (or booze). I recently found out that kombucha has trace amounts of alcohol in it. However I've never felt buzzed after drinking it...What are y'all's opinions on it? Should I stop drinking it and find another favorite drink? Should I stop if I begin to rely on it because of the trace amounts of alcohol? What would you do or what would your sponsor likely tell you?..I'm not looking for loopholes by drinking fermented tea with trace amounts of alcohol in it. I am trying to be as honest and sincere in my recovery in order to hopefully prevent a relapse in the future. I'm trying to do everything the best way I can...Any advice input or opinions would be greatly appreciated. ,5,4js8bv,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/4js8bv/kombucha_and_aa/,21,2016-05-17T14:00:48
Powerless_throwaway,Permanently on step 1: Moment of Clarity > Relapse > Repeat,I'm 26 and I've been going to meetings off and on for 8 years; my longest period of uninterrupted sobriety was about 90 days (and about a month after that after drinking once). I have been through in patient treatment 3 times and out patient treatment about a dozen different times. I have never been off of probation for more than a year and been to jail about 6 times. I got my first OVI 6 years ago and have gotten 2 more with in several months of getting my license back each time. I have numerous possession charges and a drug trafficking felony. ..Recently I just spent a month in jail and was out for 3 days before I relapsed in those 3 days I went to 7 different meetings and spent time with my sponsor (who I obtained in jail because they run meetings for inmates) and co-sponsor that I met the day I got out of jail. In jail I read the first 165 pages as well as the doctors opinion and some of the appendix all of which I've read before. I was really truly broken down this time or so I thought. I'm an atheist but I began praying/meditation and was feeling really good and thought that maybe I had conquered the 2nd step. Toward the end I was reciting the 3rd step prayer (pg 63) in the morning and at night and my sponsor agreed that if I felt ready I could start writing my 4th step. ..Well I don't know what happened but I'm completely back to my old way of thinking since the weekend has passed. I started to get very angry and resentful and a lot of the God talk because the meetings around here are very churchy. It's like people can't accept that I have a different view: they say it can be what ever you want and how you understand it then turn around and say that you will know when God starts talking to you. Well what if my conception of a higher power is incapable of communicating with me? What if I don't understand it because I don't want to make leaps of faith and disregard logic?? I know I made huge steps in jail and could keep going with them but now I feel uncomfortable praying like I was. Despite all the stupid shit I do I am certain than Im intelligent why can't I wrap my head around this? ..I walked out of a meeting last night because I was pissed at something the lead said. I waited outside for my co-sponsor and we talked for a while but I still ended up making my way to one of my old drinking spots. Someone that knew that I was trying to stay sober was at the bar and begged me not to drink but I did it anyway. ..I told my co-sponsor tonight when they picked me up for a meeting and they were disappointed but said that I did the right thing by talking about it. They offered to take me to another meeting afterwards but I made up an excuse that I was tired. Now I'm sitting at home with a 40oz and a tall boy wondering if I'm one of those people who suffer from grave emotional or mental disorders or am constitutionally incapable of being honest with myself. ..Im staying at my parents house and if they find out I'm drinking I'll be out on the street before I know it with 39 cents in my bank account because I blew what little money I had on cigarettes and now beer after jail. Shit my co-sponsor even gave me 20 bucks the other day. If I violate my probation I'm going back to jail for 11 more months and would rather face death than deal with the ignorance from other inmates and the disgusting abuse of power from the jail staff. I'm obviously powerless and at the end of my rope here but I keep making up excuses...Maybe I haven't hit rock bottom... Or maybe I'm just doomed to be helpless and will be yet another casualty of this disease. I haven't drank any of my beer yet and am considering coming out to my family and asking to go to treatment again but I know they can't afford it and I don't have insurance. I know I should call my sponsor co-sponsor or one of the many numbers I have but I feel trapped when I talk to any of those people. They don't let me finish a complete thought let alone explain half of what I just explained in this post before proselytizing me. ..Am I hopeless? ,3,4joxnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/4joxnz/permanently_on_step_1_moment_of_clarity_relapse/,9,2016-05-16T23:17:31

stanimal42,1 year sober and never going back,Part 1 the beginning..You might say that I am not as extreme of an alcoholic as some.  I started drinking at the age of 15. I remember going over to a friends house for a birthday party.  The were all over on the side of the house with a beer bong constructed of a rubber bicycle tube attached to a funnel.  I had never had alcohol before that.  I probably took down two beers and had a blast.  Since then alcohol was a party drug.  Only on weekends and never alone.  Played football and baseball in college.  Partied on the weekends but only after the game never during the week.  After college the stress begins.  Job bills new people boss and travel.  I'll never forget the first time I went to the liquor store and drank at home alone one night after work in my home.  I suddenly dawned on me that I could drink whenever I wanted to.  Then came the daily drinks after work during lunch and sometimes at my desk in a concealed coffee cup with a top.  Thinking back my colleagues had to smell it on me.  After getting married and having kids I was drinking all the time.  Take the trash out and guzzle a few beers or vodka out of the refrigerator in the garage.  Waiting until the family went to sleep to crack another beer wine or whiskey.  Before long I knew I had a problem.  Like many of you I tried to quit a few times then convinced myself I could control it.....ha...like most alcoholics do.  I must have tried to quit a dozen times.  Sad to say peer pressure was the biggest culprit.  Going to a friends house on the weekends with the family for a bbq.  I would get offered a beer and I felt like I couldn't let this guy down.....he wouldn't want to be my friend any more if I didn't take up the offer.  Throughout the course of my marriage it seemed like 95% of our arguments were when I had a few drinks.  It started to take a toll on us.  Fast forward a few years and I finally woke up and said no more.  Actually it was the day before.  A family had invited us to go on a boating trip for a few days.  My wife didn't want to go with our young kids because she knew I would be drinking the entire time with the other guys that are also heavy drinkers.  We declined with the excuse that we had something else going on that weekend.  I then realized I was going to deprive my family of a memorable weekend on the lake all because I couldn't do it sober.  How selfish.  It was then I realized this thing had control over me.  I finally put it behind me forever.  It was like a huge monkey off my back.  No more hang overs no more fights with my wife no more depression no more anxiety No more beer belly and on and on and on...Part 2 Getting Sober..The first 3 days were brutal.  I couldn't stop thinking about it.  Could I treat myself to just one more.  Driving by the local watering holes on the way home just thinking how good a cold beer would taste.  I constantly reminded myself of the horrible feeling of hangovers are and the terrible regret I feel when I let myself down.  Each day was a little easier.  Day 3 was the most difficult for some reason.  In previous attempts I would go to a party and get a dark beer bottle go to the bathroom....poor out the beer and fill it with water.  This way people wouldn't ask me why I wasn't drinking.  Now I am over it.  I am doing it for me and my family.  I don't announce to the world I am not drinking I just say "no I'm good" or "No thanks".  If someone asks why I'm not drinking I just tell them I'm not in the mood to drink.  It's funny though.  I think we always feel like people are watching us and really care about our drinking.  I have found that people really don't care and it's not a big deal.  ..Part 3 The sober life..My life has changed so much for the better.  Once you give up alcohol it's like the handcuffs have been unlocked.  So much more time on my hands more time with my family golfing and work is so much easier now.  My income has increased significantly I'm in sales.  Maybe because I have more energy and without realizing it I am contacting more clients and in tune with the field of potential (Higher Power).  I can't ever imagine a life bogged down by alcohol.  Wish I would have realized it earlier in life but I am glad I have a lot of good years ahead of me.  To those struggling with relapse.  Just have faith.  You will get there if you want to be sober you will be.  Sometimes we just have to let it run it's course but in the end if you want it bad enough you will achieve.  I know it sounds cliche but life is so much better and wonderful without the booze.,12,4fpni7,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/4fpni7/1_year_sober_and_never_going_back/,6,2016-04-20T17:26:26

TheOriginalKnockoff,Am I crazy?,First off let me say that I am beyond grateful for AA. The program has saved my life no doubt about it. I love my sponsor. But lately I've been feeling apathetic towards meetings and such as a whole. Maybe it's my location but there's a certain level of clique-iness that I'm having trouble working around..    I have been in the program for almost three years sober for almost two and a half. Most people in the program are lovely but maybe....insincere? I have people telling me they love me after meeting me twice but they can't get my name right. My facebook feed is littered with people in the program for one hanging out and socializing and I haven't found my crowd. People will say "Oh we need to hang out." "Oh I'll call you." And they never call. .    For my part I am shy and reserved but friendly. I have a hard time opening up and speaking at meetings because of my inner isolationist. Another reason I don't share much is because when I was first getting sober (struggling) there was one woman (who can't share at a meeting without mentioning how young she was when she got sober) who acting appalled and disgusted that I had relapsed..    I'm sorry if I seem ungracious I've just been dreading meetings and am sick of feeling like the fifth wheel. I hate feeling this way about such a great program. Has anyone else ever felt this way? And how did you overcome it?,4,44zt2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/44zt2z/am_i_crazy/,15,2016-02-09T19:07:20

hello_fromtheoutside,I need advice about my dad...,My dad is an alcoholic. He has been for my entire life. My mother hid it from my brother and me pretty well when we were younger and he finally got sober when I was 5 or 6. He didn't have any relapses (that I know of) until I was about 16 or 17. That's when I learned the truth about it. They were ugly but he would always go back to normal after about a two week bender. ...Well I'm now 25 and the benders are becoming more and more frequent. He's horrible to my mother who is a saint and takes care of him. I'm living across the country and they seem to pop up when I'm coming home for a visit which I am in about a month. ..I know he suffers from depression. He knows he has a problem and he always cries and says how he's going to get better but refuses to go to AA or receive any type of therapy or medication. My family and I are at the end of our rope. I'm trying to hold on because I love him but the father I know and love is just slipping away with every drink. ..Can anyone give me some advice on what I can do? If there's anything I can do? I'm getting married next year and I want him to be there more than anything but I can't trust him not to drink. It's getting to the point where I'm thinking I should just tell him he can't come if he doesn't stop. ..But ultimatimums don't work. ..I'm just losing hope and I could just use some advice.,5,3sk303,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/3sk303/i_need_advice_about_my_dad/,8,2015-11-12T12:46:36
tisjustbrandon,Trying to figure out how to be happy.,Recently I had relapsed after 4 almost 5 years of miserable sobriety.  I started the steps in year one and never finished them.  Didn't have a sponsor and went to meetings purely for the fellowship and not the meetings or the message.  Currently I have 1 year 4 months and some change.  I've gone through the steps with a sponsor.  I'm helping others when asked or given the oppurtunity.  But I'm still not happy...Currently I am homeless and the only option for my living situation is to live in a tiny apartment in a tiny room in a not so great area that is almost an hour drive from my work.  The reason I am "homeless" is because I got kicked out of my parents house for exhibiting addict behavior in which is one of my biggest character defects I won't get into details.

asromeburns,New Here Day 14,I just wanted to introduce myself I'm 14 days sober and my alcoholism began 10 years ago. My wife recently asked for a separation due to my constant aloofness and occasional relapses. I tried to stop for a year but would obsess about alcohol and the next time I could sneak getting drunk. After I went home and relapsed the last time she had enough and asked for a separation (now she's talking divorce but hasn't filed...yet). I saw my life crumbling and had a revelation that my obsession over alcohol had been a symptom of all my insecurities and fears. Whether she leaves me or not (still living together she's gone for 10 days with her cousin's family in Florida) is irrelevant to my sobriety. If it's meant to be it's meant to be. I can't fix anyone but myself and alcohol has been my obsession for 7 years. I'm pretty young (28) to be going to AA but I don't care. I have a sponsor and have made 16 meetings in the last 14 days.

I'm going to reset the clock to 0 and attend my homegroup Thursday.,One thing that complicates things for me is that I used pot to get away from the alcohol for 5 pleasant years...  but I don't want to go back to pot this time...I'm thinking of checking into a halfway house for the first couple of weeks - I have pretty severe physical and very bad psychological problems whenever I quit cold turkey...Any encouragement welcomed.,17,3fstv3,http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/3fstv3/ok_wife_died_october_2014_been_on_a_relapse_since/,13,2015-08-04T17:56:47
nobleman415,Anyone else have conflicts with their S.0. and AA ?,Hi all.  I created a new account just for writing to this sub.  I wanted to ask if anyone else in a committed relationship has problems or conflicts that have come about as a result of AA?  Well not directly a result of working the program but more of a mismatched priority list.  I've been in the program for about 7 months now with one major relapse after 60 days and what I feel like is another one right around the corner.  For most of my adult life I've been a highly-functional alcoholic but as time goes on that balance between functioning and failing has started to tip.  I realized I wasn't just "having fun" or "relaxing" anymore early this year and decided to do something about it...I also happen to be married and have two young children (my son is almost 4 and my daughter is only 3 months old). My wife is able to stay at home with our daughter while I take my son to pre-school during the week...I've found that attending meetings is getting harder and harder.  I feel like I have a choice of: A) Missing my meeting and being present with my family.B) Attending meetings after work or in the evening usually this means a guaranteed fight with the wife because I'm not there to put my son to bed or I'm unable to help with the housework that happens between those few precious hours between kids going to bed and when it is time for me to turn in...At the moment I happen to be visiting my wife's family on the east coast. There are only a handful of meetings here. Today there were meetings at 6 a.m. another at 7 pm and another at 8 p.m. I decided to attend the 8 p.m.  I've also just had an disagreement with my wife about attending. Despite the grandparents being here I'm still necessary for getting my son to bed and my wife said (and I quote) "You're not at home and you're not alone you need to stop thinking about yourself and your problems.  I'll support you going to a meeting but it needs to be at a time that is convenient for everyone not just you". So we looked over the calendar it turns out that the 6 a.m. meetings are the only ones that are some-what convenient for the rest of the family though not for me in any way.  ..I should also mention that I'm working remotely which means I'm sitting in my father-in-laws basement conveniently right next to the liquor cabinet for 8-10 hours a day.  I think I'll have to go buy a wireless router to get myself out of this space looking at the booze and knowing that I could easily drink here while everyone else is in bed and no one else would know has crossed my mind...But enough with my whining. Has anyone else had disagreements or differing priorities in your relationships when it comes to AA?  I know that whatever you put in front of sobriety you lose. It feels like the deck is stacked though... If I put family before sobriety I can't attend meetings or find the space/time to work the program.  If I put sobriety before my family I feel like the strain would break the already-stressed relationship with my wife.  Any advise here?  ,6,3fspf2,http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/3fspf2/anyone_else_have_conflicts_with_their_s0_and_aa/,15,2015-08-04T17:23:38
[deleted],not an alcoholic but need some advice,so i have started seeing a girl who is in AA. she apparently had a big problem (day drinking every day driving and showing up to work drunk) but a drunk driving accident put her in the program and she has been sober for a little while (8 months then a relapse but 4 months since). i had a bit of a problem with alcohol after my divorce but realized that wasn't who i was and forced myself to learn self discipline. it was an incredibly hard struggle but i can drink responsibly while having fun and have been distancing myself from my friends that were problem drinkers. my main problem was how much of my life revolves around alcohol. i work at a bar that is known for their high end beer selection my brother manages a brewery close friends own a beer distributor other friends at a winery. i have noticed since i started talking to this girl that every social event i go to alcohol is at least abundant if not the focal point. i am worried that hanging out with me could lead her down the path to relapse. she says she is fine with it and doesn't mind being around it or talking about it. i try not to dwell on alcohol and be sensitive and supportive but it's in my nature to be a worrier. i care about this girl and if she says she can't be around me for her own good i would understand but i don't think either of us want that. anyone who has been in the program have any advice for me?,1,3ej744,http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/3ej744/not_an_alcoholic_but_need_some_advice/,1,2015-07-25T01:25:22
mblue22,I haven't been able to catch a meeting and I don't want to relapse!,Hello. ..My name is Max and I am a recovering alcoholic/addict.  I have not been working the best program recently and I have been honest with myself my therapist my significant other and my sponsor about it.  I used to have a few years of clean time but this year has been rough with two horrible relapses...When I don't work a good program be of service go to meetings and the like I am in danger of old thinking and behavior that leads to my relapsing.  ..I know this time being sober is different because I will go to any lengths to stay sober. I mean for god sakes im posting in an AA reddit because I couldn't make the meeting I planned on making today just to ensure that I don't disconnect too much from my HP...Today is a Mormon Holiday in Utah and I had a plan of attending a 3pm meeting but this was kaboshed by the fact that all the errands I needed to run were cut out of "my order" because of the limited holiday hours. I ended up missing the meeting and now I head to work for the rest of the evening.  ..I have to keep turning my will and life over to the power of the god of my understanding.  Everything that is happening is an opportunity to learn something and to use the spiritual tools I have gained over the past few months of being sober this time. ..I will continue to pray for the next right action I will call an alcoholic on my way to work to make sure I am being accountable and I will not put myself in dangerous situations where I could relapse...I am so scared of relapse I don't know that I can survive another one.  Usually when I disconnect from my program I don't feel anxious about it I feel empowered to use.  The fact that I have so much fear I think is a good thing.  It shows how desperate I am to stay sober...I have had multiple opportunities over the past few days to make it to meetings and although my ass is falling off I have made conscious decisions to put off my recovery. My recovery normally comes number one.  My depression has been terrible and I think I need to see my doctor about switching medications again in relation to my PTSD...I don't know that anyone will reply to this but I hope reading the insanity that can take over with just a few days away from the program will help keep someone else sober.  If you have any advice or can share about your strength experience and hope in regards to alcoholism and what you have done when you self sabotage your recovery or disconnect I would appreciate it...<3..,9,3ehwa1,http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/3ehwa1/i_havent_been_able_to_catch_a_meeting_and_i_dont/,7,2015-07-24T18:09:18
[deleted],Getting sober with Concerta,Hey Guys! So I'm a college student and am trying to get sober again. I was sober for about 9 months and then relapsed. It's taken me about a year to get back into the rooms. Before alcohol became a problem and after it became a problem I have always struggled with focusing in class and as a result have been prescribed adderall vyvanse and now Concerta. These drugs truly work for me but for some reason now I want to drink when I take them. Right now I'm on the smaller dose of Concerta they make. I've already tried smoking cigarettes (I know not good) but it doesn't seem to curb my cravings. Is this a common side effect for others? I'm just scared that if I stop taking it my already tarnished collegiate academic career that I've worked so hard to repair will suffer once again but on the flip side I can't seem to stay sober more than a couple days when taking it. I don't know what to do. Thank you everyone here. This is a great sub!,5,3djwoy,http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/3djwoy/getting_sober_with_concerta/,7,2015-07-16T17:34:13

Kcrazy1011,Did I relapse...,I haven't drink since nov 23rd of last year but over the weekend I did some Molly at a party. Molly has never been my drug of choice my problem was alcohol and cocaine. I have done every drug imaginable except molly and wanted to try it and have fun. I stopped going to meetings about a month ago... and going to the party I had intentions of doing ecstasy. Another thing is that I have had it on my mind that im going to end up drinking so why not just do it now...... Did I relapse? it was only molly and I'm not going to do it again.... Id hate to throw away 7 months :( Also If I did relapse I feel like I should just go have a drink... one last time because id rather relapse on alcohol then stupid molly..... lol..,4,3bwdrq,http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/3bwdrq/did_i_relapse/,15,2015-07-02T14:21:36

[deleted],I seriously need any help I can get right now. Any support or advice would be greatly appreciated.,I'm sorry and I don't know the rules but Askreddit wouldn't let me submit and I'm in desperate need of help. I'm a recovering alcoholic and have been sober for a year and four months and drinking is the last thing I care to do. I just broke up with my ex (recovering addict) of 9 months yesterday and decided we should just be friends. We are both young and I have my own place but she's still with her parents. She came over earlier tonight to talk and starts going through my phone and computer... ..After reading a text from a girl (literally asked a coworker to cover shift) she freaks out throws my phone at me starts punching me and kicking and attacking me. I tried holding her down but everytime I let go she would get back up and attack me. . I run and hide in the bathroom and lock the door and just start bawling crying and have been since... ..I just don't understand how she could treat me like that and how I can let that happen when I know she can be sweet. She suffers from Borderline Personality disorder and I've done my best to help her through it but its killing me. After sitting in the bathroom bawling she comes back into my apartment bawling and freaking out saying she just relapsed on meth. This literally kills me inside even more after I thought I couldn't hurt any more than I already was. I've never done anything other than drink and hard drugs are something I've never encountered. She tried shoving it under the door for me to flush and I'm freaking out crying because I'm hurting so bad... ..I eventually convince her to call her dad and the whole time while he's on the way she's on the other side of the door bawling telling me how sorry she is and how she just fucked everything up and her 9 months of sobriety. It's literally tearing me apart because I do care for her and I hate hearing her so sad about a mood disorder and drug addiction she can't control. I'm emotionally devastated right now... ..After she left I found out who it was that gave her the meth and it's a guy that I am/was friends with from the local vape shop. He knew me and my ex gf because we were in there all the time and I can't believe he would do this to her and to us. I want to kill him right now and to beat his fucking ass for giving her meth but I can't. My ex texted me saying that if I do anything I will get hurt (by him she knows him a lot better than I do) and if I report him to the cops it's 100% certain that he will know it's me. I don't know what to do I'm heartbroken I can't stop crying but I'm also filled with anger.

Well tonight I was bored and home alone so I decided to buy a 6 pack. I drank 2 1/2 beers and I felt like shit and hated the way it tasted. I'm glad I can't drink anymore I guess I had to find out myself. I threw the other beers away. I thank God for taking my taste for alcohol away I just wish I would have never drank.

vicodinmistake,Reset my sobriety date?,This May 21 would be my 9th AA birthday. About a month ago I had a surgery that had complications causing major pain for which I received a prescription for hydrocodone (Vocodin). One night I took two pills instead of the prescribed one not because one wasn't killing the pain but because I wanted to feel the Vicodin. I told my wife what I'd done that same night used the medicine properly from then on and when the pain was manageable I dumped the rest of the pills. Now it was alcohol that brought me to AA I'd never taken an opiate before this prescription so I don't consider a "relapse" but I do recognize I've broken the spirit of my program and used a drug for entertainment outside of my legit prescription for pain. So tell me would you reset your sobriety date in this situation or counsel your sponsee to do so?,5,33vrib,http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/33vrib/reset_my_sobriety_date/,10,2015-04-25T22:30:00
hawk234,Struggling right now,I relapsed 5 days ago. I blew up my relationship. Shattered trust with every loved one I have. It's because I quit going to meetings and those character flaws I had been working on came back with a vengeance because I quit working on them. Don't be like me. Don't go back out it doesn't get better it gets worse. And I know it'll get better now that I'm in the meeting rooms again and have a sponsor again. I'm just struggling with the guilt and self loathing of all the lies I told leading to this relapse. Here's to one day at a time. Hoping I can get back to being someone I can love and respect as well as others.

childOfAAParents,REALLY NEED HELP! Most of family is in recovery and I feel trapped between what I feel/think and what I know my family wants for me.,I am using a throwaway because I am not sure how everyone will respond to this. I also don't feel comfortable sharing this in a meeting because I really don't want anyone saying "keep coming back" in that sarcastic way that people do sometimes or people coming up to me to try to show me I am in denial. I apologize in advance for the wall of text. A little background: I got sober when I was 22 (am 31 now). A little before my nine year anniversary I relapsed. I am sober now but right before I relapsed I was having a lot of issues with AA and a higher power. When I first got sober I was convinced that AA and the 12 steps were going to be a part of my life forever. I had a spiritual awakening many sponsees and was an active member of AA. About 3 years ago I watched my mother almost drown and there was nothing I could do. My father had drowned about a year before I got sober too. I had a lot of questions about the universe and God and though I asked for help I never really took action. This time I still have the same questions but I am taking a lot of action. But here is where it gets tricky. All three of my parents (Dad Mom and Step-Father) have been sober my entire life and longer. While drinking of course it was a bummer for me but after I got sober the first time it was a true blessing. My uncle husband and brother-in-law also have long-term sobriety. But now I am realizing more than ever that I feel trapped to obtain sobriety only through the 12 steps. I have never actually tried being sober using any other means. When I was 22 I went to a long term rehab center for what I thought was 3 months but ended up being 9 and I still didn't "graduate". At that treatment center I basically ended up getting a PhD in the big book. I subscribed to the primary purpose philosophy for a while but when I started becoming unhappy with that way of life I stopped acting like I knew everything as best as I could. It was and still is very hard because I constantly judge and feel judged for not doing it the "right" way. While it's a worthy personal journey in my family there is a very strict "right" way of being sober: go to AA trust God clean house (work the 12 steps) and help other alcoholics. I recently stopped going to meetings because it was making me feel worse and I stopped relating to other alcoholics. I am sure you are thinking (denial...justification...etc.) but that is my truth right now. If I had a clueless family it would be hard because they perhaps wouldn't understand my disease but in so many ways it would be amazing because ultimately it would be myself that makes the decision to seek help from AA. I also don't think I would be so sensitive to the dogma that shows up in meetings at times. I am constantly terrified to talk about how I truly feel in my family because it often upsets them and they definitely judge me. I know it is because they are scared that I will relapse again so on some level I understand. But it's like being gay in a super religious family. It is very hard for me to be honest about my feelings because I get yelled at pitied or get long lectures about how what I am doing is dangerous. If it were up to me I would just keep my feelings and thoughts to myself and my close friends but they consistently ask me questions about where I am with my recovery which invariably leads to a fight. The thing is I truly believe I am an alcoholic. I also pretty much believe I need to go to AA and work the steps if I want to stay sober I think but don't know for sure because that has always been a given in my family. I feel like I don't get to personally make that decision for myself without upsetting most of my family. I know if I tried any other way there would be a rift. Again it would be like someone who came out to their family and went home for a holiday. Sure they love me but they highly disapprove of my lifestyle. I want the freedom to not do it "right". Does that make any sense? I am currently helping others seeking spirtual help outside of AA and am in therapy once a week with a group. I am also being completely honest with my husband and close friends even if I deem the thoughts and feelings I have as "bad" or going against what I have learned in AA (which is VERY different from before). I am just at a loss of what to do here...TL;DR - Am in a family of recovering alcoholics. Their belief that the only successful way to be sober is to attend AA and work the 12 steps has me feeling trapped between what I feel/think and what I know they want from me.,5,2zbeew,http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/2zbeew/really_need_help_most_of_family_is_in_recovery/,14,2015-03-17T00:13:40
Interstellar_Furries,Advice for living with an Alcoholic,Hello all - so the place I moved into recently I found out the land lady's son is an alcoholic after noticing my bottle of whiskey disappeared from my room. I asked her about and found out he relapsed a few nights ago when I was out of town presumably from my whiskey. I feel awful his relapse was partially due to me but I didn't know at the time and he did go into my room which is in another side of the house. ..Any advice on how to avoid this issue in the future. More importantly how do I talk to him about it? We got along well before the incident and now he avoids any contact with me. I'm not mad about what happened. I understand.

Goose1963,Trying to get back to meetings after a very long relapse.,I was sober for 8 years through AA.   I spent that last 15 years trying to wrestle my alcoholism into submission.  This has been a roller coaster of thousands of times of trying to have one or two drinks and ending up on a long binge.  Lately I've been trying to not drink on work nights but the longer I stop the bigger the binge is the next time I try to have one or two.   .     The last time I got sober I rarely spoke at meetings but I got the help I needed outside of meetings.  I feel part of my problem is social anxiety and I probably never solved that in my last sobriety.  I tried to go to a meeting last night but it was closed then I couldn't find 2 others.  I did successfully go to one this morning and it was great but I was mortified that I would be asked to speak in front of the big group.  I want to continue going  I should go to another one tonight but how do I get over this fear of large groups?  I also have fears that I'll see someone from work or someone that I was an asshole to while drunk..,6,2ufwvn,http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/2ufwvn/trying_to_get_back_to_meetings_after_a_very_long/,9,2015-02-01T15:43:23
carebox,Intro/Question: Did I work the steps too fast? (long),Hello! My name here is carebox and I'm an alcoholic. ..**Intro:**.I'm 21 years old and have attended meetings regularly since I was 19. The first 8 months after my first meeting I relapsed all the time while slacking in the steps and not reading the book (read: my sponsor told me to do this I didn't and lied about it). After about 6 months I told my sponsor that I wasn't willing enough and told her to stop sponsor me and went out to drink again. ..The 25th of august 2013 was my first real sobrietydate I changed sponsor and was like "yes captain" to everything she said and really worked it. When I was 7 months sober I started doing my amends. The first five or so went fast (like one to two per week) and then everything stopped. People who I reached out for didn't answer or declined. According to her it also could do more harm than good to force amends on them. Like writing a letter was bad if we lived in the same city and they declined to meet over a coffee. .Also "I wasn't ready for step ten and eleven" since I should've done at least half of my amends according to my sponsor at the time. So for about two months I felt like my stepwork faded away. It started with me not wanting to make more amends then my defects of character was suddenly something I could use to succeed in life then my HP disappeared and suddenly I was an alcoholic who could manage my life and had full control over it. Then I relapsed...**Now (-ish):**.This time around I worked the steps with another sponsor and went through steps 1 to 11 in three weeks in one and a half month I started working the 12th step. We read and marked important stuff in the book and we did it all from there. No halfmeasures we were (and I am still) fearless and thorough all the way. .Step 10 and 11 gave me my higher power in a compleatly different way than step 2 and 3 did. Now I trust my HP completely. And also It gave me stepwork on a daily basis. It feels like as long as I'm doing exactly this I will never drink or do drugs again and it doesn't scare me shitless. It doesn't make me feel awkward or anything like that. .And I think the biggest change is that I feel stuff and it's not killing me and I'm not always acting out on the emotions. I can be sad. Like pretty fucking chest crushing sad. And I can be angry like wanting to blow up a building angry. And I can be filled with serenity and happiness...**Question:**.Now (sober for five months) when I raise my hand as an available sponsor people comment it. One girl thought I did the steps to fast and believe my recovery is just a happy phase in the beginning and that it won't last. Another thinks I haven't been sober long enough to sponsor. But the big book says nothing about timelimits.. (except for maybe a passage in the chapter to our wives which talks about weeks. Not that explaining though)..**Do you people think I've done it too fast? Should I start over and do it slower? should I not raise my hand as an available sponsor?** ,2,2o24ux,http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/2o24ux/introquestion_did_i_work_the_steps_too_fast_long/,11,2014-12-02T11:52:52
[deleted],Cough syrup relapse?,I some times take nyquil to help me sleep since benadryl no longer works. I called a friend that has been sober for like 38 years and told him that I was taking recommended dose to help sleep. It has 10 percent alcohol. He would consider it a relapse and I don't. What's your guys thought on that?,9,2mu17b,http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/2mu17b/cough_syrup_relapse/,12,2014-11-19T21:00:04
dollhairs412,4 Step venting maybe I need a fresh set of eyes on my current situation,Hello everyone my screen name is Dollhairs412 and I'm an alcoholic...A lot is running through my mind right now and I don't normally share details with other people outside of my friends so I will try to stick to the basic facts of my current situation...My history:.I'm in my mid-30's. I was a daily pot smoker who would drink every night. Towards the end of my addiction I began experimenting with snorting heroin before I overdosed on a bad batch. I've been clean and sober for 17 months...Other facts:.I have been battling life long depression (I'm seeing a counselor and taking meds). My memory is poor. I tend to forget things easily these days. ..My Situation:.Currently I go to meetings once every two weeks these days. I use to go to meetings more frequently and for a year I chaired a meeting. I have a Sponsor who I stay in touch with (infrequently these days) and he has been asking me about my progressing on the 4th Step. To be completely honest I just feel like stopping totally not relapsing just not working on the steps. If I had to list reasons why I have stopped working on the steps A) I'm afraid my Sponsor will ask me to take a Sponsee and B) I don't want to make amends...A) I do not want a Sponsee because I feel extremely uncomfortable with strangers. I also feel I would do a poor job at being a Sponsor...B) I can't make amends to some people because it would make things worse and those who I could amends to I feel I would do a half-assed job and would be just doing it to keep up appearances or to score brownie points...In Conclusion:.My sponsor tells me I will feel better when I complete the steps but in all honesty my life feels good right now as it is and I don't see it getting any better. The only real cravings I get is to smoke pot every now and then...Does anyone have any input or advice?,6,2miksq,http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/2miksq/4_step_venting_maybe_i_need_a_fresh_set_of_eyes/,7,2014-11-16T20:13:32
houston_oilers,How Do You Explain to a Non-Drinker Why Alcoholics Relapse?,Background: I've had two relapses in the last 11 months. I'm actually getting better. I've been in treatment since September however I relapsed a week and a half ago and I'm meeting with someone who has the power to fire me after I've spent a significant amount of time with the organization. Things will be what they will be and I'm not going to make excuses...That said when the inevitable question of "What happened?" or "Why would you drink when you know you have an issue with it?" I would like to be able to convey that I want sobriety I'm working toward it I'm making progress but relapses do happen...How would you help a non-drinker understand why an alcoholic would relapse despite his or her best interests?.,8,2mesc7,http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/2mesc7/how_do_you_explain_to_a_nondrinker_why_alcoholics/,7,2014-11-15T16:19:06
howaminot,AA after 7 years . . .,Yay it's been 7 years without a drink or a drug! BUTT..Boo! there are new roadblocks that have arisen in my program.  Any other "middle aged" AAers struggle with any of this?  What's your experience?..I am young-ish in a big city and have been going to meetings sporadically for the last 4ish years - before that it was 1-3 mtgs/day.  I get frustrated hearing others share things that strike me as really unhealthy or judgmental and it makes it hard to get my butt in a chair.  I feel kind of unsafe or alienated a lot when I'm in a meeting.  ..I also see guys there that I remember totally preying on me and my littermates when I was a newcomer and it still makes me feel kind of ragey.  And they're still up to their old antics.  I'm aware of my role in these thoughts but still find it hard to make myself get to a darn meeting!  My sponsor suggested I really focus on compassion for others in the rooms (and myself) and I think that's a great start...My sobriety has been really real- lots of great things lots of hard things friends relapsing/dying and relationships changing. I'm definitely not the same lady that got sober years ago...In this city we talk about newcomers relapse and old timers and I don't feel like I get a lot of insight on the middle years.  Any thoughts?,8,2kph5g,http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/2kph5g/aa_after_7_years/,8,2014-10-29T15:56:22
BothWaysGoMe,I'm starting to relapse after going through a traumatic experience. Any advice?,Long story short a man I thought was maintenance almost choked me to death in my bathroom at the age of 20. For some reason he stopped I survived and he is in jail now.  I handled it really well for a while but I think that was just because I was in denial about my mental state.  But not I find my self drinking more and more and I need some advise on how to cope without alcohol and how to resist the urge to have another drink. ,6,2jydyr,http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/2jydyr/im_starting_to_relapse_after_going_through_a/,10,2014-10-21T22:31:16
m3du5a,Important test of my sobriety this week,As of today I've been sober for 54 days which is a new world record. Every day is uncharted territory for me now. I've been going to meetings since early January and until my previous relapse I was sober for 37 days. ...This week I have a week off from work and these have been traditionally particularly dangerous times for me - often involving going away staying in cheap hotels ending up drinking enough vodka to seriously harm any normal person. Doing that was never my intention but it's always ended up being that way. That's what happened on my last relapse. I was intending to visit a theme park but came back 7 days later after spending the entire week in blackout. ...For some reason I had my big book with me when I was away during that relapse and for some reason I got it out and started reading it (and listening to it on a podcast when reading became too much of a struggle). It sunk in. One of the few things which I do remember from that week is looking into the mirror after struggling to keep down some vitamin B tablets and actually saying out loud "look at yourself" - I witnessed first-hand for the first time that I was an alcoholic of the hopeless variety which it talks about in the book. ...I got a sponsor and bought the big book back in January. I thought I'd made it - I had done everything that was asked. The problem is that I didn't read the book or call my sponsor. He didn't call me either. For this I am eternally grateful. I needed to go on my own journey to fully understand what step 1 was talking about. I'd had my rock bottoms - those were why I was in the rooms but I hadn't quite finished learning just how powerless I was and am. ...Since then I have been actually working the program. I have been calling my sponsor (though not often enough) calling other alcoholics trying my 90 in 90 reading literature praying in the morning (though I'm still not very good at that) and going through the steps. I'm feeling better physically and mentally. Life is still tough and definitely not beyond my wildest dreams yet but it is manageable. I even enjoy and look forwards to going to meetings now!...I will be going to at least one meeting a day next week perhaps visit some in different towns and cities. I hope that I can go along to my home group on Friday and proudly announce that I have 2 months. I've been warned that the disease will talk to me and taunt me into going back to the bottle because the days will not be filled with work. I'm confident that I can - right now I don't want to drink. I do have an alcoholic mind however so I'm ready for this week to be a challenge. ...I just wanted to write all of this down so that it's real and I've acknowledged the danger. Thanks very much for reading :) ,1,26dsp6,http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/26dsp6/important_test_of_my_sobriety_this_week/,0,2014-05-24T12:11:44
